# Setting Up

To use the Visual Framework your machine will require some software to be installed to start.

The software you will need is:

  - Node.js
  - Gulp

You can check to see if you have these installed in the command line by entering the name of the package with -v afterwards, for example.

```
$ node -v

$ gulp -v
```

If either of these throw an error in your command line application then you will need to install them.

## To install Node

The easiest way to download and install Node is via the official [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/) where you can download the correct version for your operating system.

## To install Gulp

Once you have Node install you can easily install the Gulp task manager by entering the following command into your command line application:

```
npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli -g
```
