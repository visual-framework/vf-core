# Tags component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-tags.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-tags)

## About

A high-density list of meta-information links often found at the bottom of piece of content and similar to citations.

## Usage

Use this component for secondary nice-to-have information. Tags are typically a high-density cluster of information that is not easily scannable by users. They are often of more use to search engines and users searching a page for information.

If you have critical user-journey lists of links, you should use a `vf-list` instead.

This component should not be confused with `vf-badge` which indicates the status of an item.
