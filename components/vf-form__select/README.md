# Form Select component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-form__select.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-form__select)

## About

Let site visitors pick one option from a list of options in a 'drop down'.

## Usage

The `vf-form__select` allows a site visitor to pick an available option from a group of options.

The options inside of a `vf-form__select` should be in alpabetical order.

### When to use

You should try to use the `vf-form__select` as a last resort for giving site visitors a choice to pick one thing from a group of things. If possible you should use a group `vf-form__radio` inputs.

### When not to use

If the list of options is relatively small you should use a group of `vf-form_radio` inputs.

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-form__select` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-form__select
```

### Sass/CSS

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-form__select/index.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/components/vf-sass-starter/)
