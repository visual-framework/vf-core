## About

The `vf-breadcrumb` component is a navigational item that can identify to the site visitor their location on the website. They are a visual representation of the site's heirachy.

## Usage

The `vf-breadcrumb` component should follow the `vf-global-header` in the page layout.

It should list no more than three items, including the current page. Each link in the component is separated by a `>` chevron. The page you are on should display an 'active' state in the breadcrumbs which is bold with no underline.

### Related breadcrumbs

The "Related" variant allows you to indicate related items as additional navigation to the page the site visitor is on. They should be placed inside the `vf-breadcrumbs` `<nav>` element and be a seperate unordered list.

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-breadcrumbs` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-breadcrumbs
```
