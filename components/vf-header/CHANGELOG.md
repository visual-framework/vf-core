### 3.0.0

* vf-header was an early concept on how we might accommodate multi-layers of branding ... but:
    * It was never successfully used in production
    * Is out of date technically and visually
    * Has questionable IA/UX merritt in the current context
* Therefore it is being deprecated.
    * No migration guidance is supplied as it is not used in production.
    * It is also being removed from the default rollup Sass/CSS.
