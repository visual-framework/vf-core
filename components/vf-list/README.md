# List component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-list.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-list)

## About

Classic html list `<li>` and `<dl>` types: order, unordered, bulleted, inline and definition.

## Usage

When presenting a series of text-only content such as words or names, consider using a list. The best list type to use will depend on the relationships between the terms.

Default variant
Use to present items without a specific order, like navigation menus or lists of features.

Tight variant
The same as the default variant, but with less space between items. Use when it would be preferable to show more items of the same list together.
Large variant
Larger items for when the list should be more prominent

Inline variant:
   - Use to display a list horizontally within a sentence or paragraph, such as a series of authors

Ordered variant:
   - Use for content with a specific sequence or order, such as steps in a process or ranked items.

Unordered variant:
   - Use to present items without a specific order, like navigation menus or lists of features.

Definition List
   - Use to show terms with definitions or descriptions

### Recommendations

Sort list items in a logical order that makes information easily scannable by the users such as: alphabetical, numerical, chronological, or by user preference.

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-list` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-list
```

### Sass/CSS

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-list/index.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/components/vf-sass-starter/)
