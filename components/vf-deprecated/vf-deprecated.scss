// **Thinking about deleting this file?**
// If your component needs no CSS/Sass, we still recommend leaving the
// scss files in place. As this is primarily a CSS framework, it is better to
// leave the empty files so you know a file wasn't accidently omitted.
// If you don't have any Sass, you can trim this block down to:
// "This page was intentionally left blank"

// @import 'vf-deprecated.variables.scss';

html:not(.vf-disable-deprecated) {

  .vf-deprecated::before {
    content: 'CSS `:before` content and custom rules that can be conditionally disabled with a parent `.vf-disable-deprecated` selector.';
