# EMBL-EBI Header and Footer component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Febi-header-footer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Febi-header-footer)

## About

This provides support for using the EMBL-EBI header and footer from the EMBL-EBI VF 1.3. It provides the minimum amount of legacy CSS to make the header and footer work while avoiding conflicts with other 2.0 styles.

### Note

- This component requires the EMBL contentHub loader, which is included in most EMBL VF builds.
- This requires VF 2.0 footer CSS and other styles.
- If you do not currently have VF 2.0 CSS and JS as part of your project, [you can use the CDN JS](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/#cdn).
- This uses the existing `//ebi.emblstatic.net/web_guidelines/EBI-Framework/v1.3/js/script.js` to load the HTML for the header.
- The EBI VF 1.x will also included a data protection banner, to disable this with 1.4 you can an included an element with `data-protection-message-disable="true"`

## Install
