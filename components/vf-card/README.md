[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-card.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-card)

## About

There are currently two types of card component that can be used for your projects. Each card component requires the additional modifier class to be added into either your `.yml` file or directly into the HTML.

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm][npm]. After [installing npm][install-npm], you can install `vf-card` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-card
```

## Usage

The source files included are written in [Sass][sass] (`scss`) You can simply point your sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-card/index.scss";
```

_Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules._
