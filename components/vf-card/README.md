# Card component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-card.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-card)

## About

There are currently two types of card component that can be used for your projects. Each card component requires the additional modifier class to be added into either your `.yml` file or directly into the HTML.

__Do Not__ have more than one variant of the `vf-card` in a container.

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). After [installing npm](https://nodejs.org/), you can install `vf-card` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-card
```

### Sass/CSS

The style files included are written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). If you're using a VF-core project, you can import it like this:

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-card/index.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/components/vf-sass-starter/)
