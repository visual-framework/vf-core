# Nearest location component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-location-nearest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-location-nearest)

## Usage

From a list of lat and long, this will use the browser geolcation API to select the nearest. It also provides a manual selection fallback and override.

This component is purely JavaScript and relies on other components to provide UI and to consume the detected region.

This is an early version, some future improvements to be considered:

- Callback to observe detected locations to be used in other components
- Allowing "or" matches for content `data-vf-js-location-nearest-activation-target="locationOne, locationTwo"`
- Enabling the default while we wait for geodetection
- "Saving" a user's location when using the override

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm][https://www.npmjs.com/]. After [installing npm][https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm] and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), you can install `vf-location-nearest` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-location-nearest
```

## JS

You should import this component in `./components/vf-component-rollup/scripts.js` or your other JS process:

```js
import { vfLocationNearest } from 'vf-location-nearest/vf-location-nearest';
// Or import directly
// import { vfLocationNearest } from '../components/raw/vf-location-nearest/vf-location-nearest.js';

// Configure an object of your locations to detect
// You should do this in your central JS (scripts.js) as appropriate
let vfLocationNearestLocations = {
  // supply a default in case of geodetect failures
  default: {
    name: "Heidelberg",
    latlon: "49.40768, 8.69079" // lat then lon
  },
  barcelona: {
    name: "Barcelona",
    latlon: "0.40768, 0.69079"
  },
  ...
  }
}
// Bootstrap location detection
vfLocationNearest(vfLocationNearestLocations);
```

### JS Data attributes

All are optional

- `data-vf-js-location-nearest-name` element will receive the name of the current location
- `data-vf-js-location-nearest-override-widget` element will be populated with an override widget (vf-form select list)
- `data-vf-js-location-nearest-activation-target="{locationId}"` will receive clicks on location change. This is a simple method to activate diverse elements.

## Sass/CSS

If your component uses Sass:

The source files included are written in [Sass][sass] (`scss`) You can simply point your sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-location-nearest/index.scss";
```

_Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules._
