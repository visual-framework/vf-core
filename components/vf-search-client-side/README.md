# Client-side Search component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-search-client-side.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-search-client-side)

## About

This uses Lunr.js to perform a client-side search of a site's content. This is recommended only for sites with a limited number of pages.

## Usage

This consumes a `.js` file with an object of pages, a la:

```
let searchIndex = {
  "pages": [
    {"id":"0", "title": "Page title", "text": "Body text of page goes here", "tags": "", "url": "/index.html"},
    ...
  ]
};
```

### Warning: Early alpha, lot's of "to do"s

This is an early alpha. More customisation options need to be added, such as:

- passing search paramaters (boost score) to the JS
- customising the output format
- NJK template has hardcoded paths for vf-core

### Building a search index

1. Index making code

To generate that JS file, if you're using a vf-eleventy based site, you may also want to make use of the `vf-extensions`'s `gulp-build-search-index.js`:

> `require('./node_modules/\@visual-framework/vf-extensions/utils/gulp-build-search-index.js')(gulp, path, buildDestionation);`

2. Dependencies

If you use that JS you'll also need some npm dependencies:

`yarn add strip-js striptags node-html-parser`

3. Tell gulp to make the index

And you should build that search index after updating your html pages, a la:

```
  // build search index after search page is compiled
  gulp.watch(['./build/search/index.html'], gulp.parallel('vf-build-search-index'));

  // And for your `build` task
  gulp.task('build', gulp.series(
    ...
    'eleventy:build',
    'vf-build-search-index',
    ...
  ));

  // And for your `dev` task
  gulp.task('dev', gulp.series(
    ...
    'eleventy:build',
    'vf-build-search-index',
    ...
  ));
```

### Using search

- You can pass a query to the search page with `?search_query=myQuery`
- The search will live update as the user enters text
- You can enable `autofocus` on the search element, but should only do so if most users intend to search on the page

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). After [installing npm](https://nodejs.org/), you can install `vf-search-client-side` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-search-client-side
```

### Sass/CSS

The style files included are written in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). If you're using a VF-core project, you can import it like this:

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-search-client-side/index.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/components/vf-sass-starter/)
