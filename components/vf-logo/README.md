# Logo component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-logo.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-logo)

## About

A simple component to add the Visual Framework logo to a page. You'll likely want to use this one as a template to add your own logo.

## Usage

This component allows you to add the vf-logo on your page. It can also serve as a template to add your own logo if it has a similar layout and design to the vf-logo. Before using it, ensure that your logo usage guidance and design layout do not conflict with the component.

Considering that texts in logoâ€™s are classified as [essential](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text#dfn-essential), there are [no contrast requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) for adding a logo. However, where possible, make sure the logo is clearly visible against the background colour.
