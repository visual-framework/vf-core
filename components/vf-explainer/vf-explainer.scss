// **Thinking about deleting this file?**
// If your component needs no CSS/Sass, we still recommend leaving the
// scss files in place. As this is primarily a CSS framework, it is better to
// leave the empty files so you know a file wasn't accidently omitted.
// If you don't have any Sass, you can trim this block down to:
// "This page was intentionally left blank"

@import 'package.variables.scss';
// Debug information from component's `package.json`:
// ---
/*!
 * Component: #{map-get($componentInfo, 'name')}
 * Version: #{map-get($componentInfo, 'version')}
 * Location: #{map-get($componentInfo, 'location')}
