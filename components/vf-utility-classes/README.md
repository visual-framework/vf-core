## About

The only thing you can count on is the unexpected, so there is a range of
utility classes.

See also the `vf-sass-utilities` component with tools around behaviour of content.

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-utility-classes` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-utility-classes
```

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.
