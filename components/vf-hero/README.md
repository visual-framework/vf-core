# Hero component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-hero.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-hero)

## About

The `vf-hero` component is to be used as a visual queue and page header. The `vf-hero` can take a heading, sub-heading, and text content. The text (`vf-hero__text`) content can also be a 'call to action' link which adds am arrow icon.

## Usage

This component should not be used inside of `vf-content`.

Currently there are now two use cases for the `vf-hero` component:


### Landing Pages

For landing pages like the home page, or a location page can take an image (provided by Design) which should be uploaded to [the files site](https://www.embl.org/files) and applied using the custom property available (`--vf-hero--bg-image`).

The `vf-hero` for landing pgaes make use of the classes `vf-hero--primary` and `vf-hero--1200` to standardise the layout through out embl.org.

By default the `vf-hero` for landing pages make use of the roundels bacground image. To keep the raw struture of the HTML and CSS the same this is applied using a CSS custom property. IE 11 will get the background colour still, but no image. This is progressive enhancement.

The basic HTML structure for landing pages is:

```
<section class="vf-hero vf-hero--primary vf-hero--1200 | vf-u-fullbleed" style="--vf-hero--bg-image-size: auto 28.5rem">

  <div class="vf-hero__content | vf-stack vf-stack--400 ">

    <h2 class="vf-hero__heading">
      About the Hentze group!
    </h2>

    <p class="vf-hero__subheading">an example of some ancillary text</p>

    <p class="vf-hero__text">The Hentze group combines biochemical and <a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">systems–level approaches</a> to investigate the connections between <a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">gene expression</a> and <a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">cell metabolism</a>, and their roles in human disease.</p>

  </div>

</section>
```

### Group Sites

For group sites that exist like a sub-site or microsite as part of embl.org they are afforded their own specific `vf-hero`.

The `vf-hero` for group sites make use of the classes `vf-hero--primary`, `vf-hero--block`, and `vf-hero--800` to standardise the layout through out embl.org.

By default the `vf-hero` for group sites make use of the roundels background image. To keep the raw struture of the HTML and CSS the same this is applied using a CSS custom property. IE 11 will get the background colour still, but no image. This is progressive enhancement.

If group leaders wish to, they can include some additional content to the heading such as their group location, and if it's part of a bigger group with the HTML structure:

```
<h2 class="vf-hero__heading">
  Strategy & Communications
  <span class="vf-hero__heading--additional">
    <a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">VF Hamburg</a> | Structural Biology
  </span>
</h2>
```

<br>

The basic HTML structure for the group site `vf-hero` is:


```
<section class="vf-hero vf-hero--primary vf-hero--block vf-hero--800 | vf-u-fullbleed" style="--vf-hero--bg-image-size: auto 28.5rem">

  <div class="vf-hero__content | vf-stack vf-stack--400 ">

    <h2 class="vf-hero__heading">

      <a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">
      Strategy &amp; Communications
      </a>

      <span class="vf-hero__heading--additional"><a href="JavaScript:Void(0);">VF Hamburg</a> | Structural Biology</span>

    </h2>

    <p class="vf-hero__subheading">Chromosome structure and dynamics</p>

  </div>

</section>
```



As the group sites variant of the `vf-hero` is used to announce the group name and some short additional information, it does not allow for the inclusion of the `vf-hero__text` element.

### CSS Custom Properties

`--vf-hero--bg-image` — this is for the url for the background image. It can either be added, inline if you're writing the HTML, using the `.yml` data source of `vf_hero_image`, or by other needs (a input or upload in WordPress, for example).

`---vf-hero--bg-image-size` — this is to determine the sizing of the background image. As group sites are using the roundel image it needs specific dimensions so that it works. These dimensions are `auto 28.5rem`. We use a fallback here as background images in `vf-hero` should be full bleed by default so the fall back in the CSS is for cover — `var(---vf-hero--bg-image-size, cover)`. For
