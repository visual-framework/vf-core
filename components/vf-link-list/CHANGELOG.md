### 1.5.0

This deprecates vf-link-list as many components are either widely unused or only seldom used â€” for the components that aren't yet used much we also have major revisions coming and we wish to discourage use of components that are about to be overhauled.

* Links List Default: use vf-list + vf-heading
* Links List no heading: use vf-list
* Links List Tight: use vf-list  (we may add a vf-list--tight variant subject to demand)
* Links List Very Easy: see above
* Links List Easy: to be overhauled as vf-navigation--on-page
* Links List Has Images: use vf-summary--has-image or vf-flag--middle

Additionally there has been a confusion between when to use vf-list and vf-link-list that we're want to address.
