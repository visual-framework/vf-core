## About

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-form` with this command.

```

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.
