# Form component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-form.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-form)

## About

The `vf-form` manages a group of form inputs and interactive controls to collect data that can be sent to a server. The `vf-form` is the wrapping component for all form elements.

## Usage

Whenever you need to use a `vf-form__item` and related input or control you need to wrap them with a `vf-form`.

The `vf-form` makes use of the `vf-stack` layout component to evenly distrubute the form inputs on a page.


## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-form` with this command. This will install all form items that work within a `vf-form` too.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-form
```

### Sass/CSS

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-form/vf-form.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/components/vf-sass-starter/)
