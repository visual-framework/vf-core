      summary__title: EMBL's top social media posts of 2017 and what we learned from them
      summary__text: I want to take a look back at my first full year as EMBL's social media manager. So what worked best over 2017 and what can I learn from this? My basic goals for VFâ€™s social media are to build community and develop a shared understanding of who we as an organisation are. Consequently, I care about what resonates on the different social sites much more than driving traffic back to Visual Framework websites, although traffic is obviously a by-product.
