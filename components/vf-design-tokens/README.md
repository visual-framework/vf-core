# Design Tokens Component

These are the colour, typography, spacing, and other stylistic decisions as design tokens for consumption

The Design Tokens used within `vf-core` are generated from several `.yml` files. These are then compiled into various Sass files as needed.


In the future we hope to offer Sketch and Photoshop colour palettes.


If you required a different format (LESS, iOS, Android). Please get in touch.


> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
