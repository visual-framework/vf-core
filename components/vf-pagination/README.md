# Pagination component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-pagination.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-pagination)

## About

A simple pagination component for long listings such as `search results`.

## Usage

[Nielsen Norman make the following recommendations about pagination](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/item-list-view-all/):

- **Do not use pagination** for linear content such as a long page or article. 
- Pagination can be useful for long listings (such as `search results`, article archives, etc) that consist of more than 100 items. If your list consists of fewer items you may not need to add pagination.
