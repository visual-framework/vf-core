# EMBL Subsite boilerplate

This is reference on the basic HTML structure for EMBL-branded pages for a
sub-section or service.

The main difference between this and the standard EMBL boilerplate is a
the usage of the `vf-masthead` component for additional identity and navigation.

## What's a sub-section or service?

These pages are generally a few layers deep in the structure of EMBL.org and
have specific needs or functionality that is separate from the main
"corporate" site.

Examples?

- EMBL.org/training/online
- EMBL.org/resources/{resource_name}
- EMBL.org/guidelines/visual-framework/dev-docs
