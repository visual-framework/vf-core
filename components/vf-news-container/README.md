# News Container component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-news-container.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-news-container)

## About

Use this component to show a section of news content. It also offers a `vf-news-container--featured` variant with support for `vf-summary` for when news is a higher level and, well, featured content on layout.

### Recommendations

In a case where the descriptive text on the image is a repetition of the adjacent text, it is recommended to use a null alternative text on the image

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-news-container` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-news-container
```

### Sass/CSS

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-news-container/index.scss";
```

Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. You can use a [project boilerplate](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/building/) or the [`vf-sass-starter`](https://stable.visual-framework.dev/components/vf-sass-starter/)
