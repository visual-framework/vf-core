// A shame.scss file for things that haven't got a
// place in the Visual Framework yet


//  this needs to become a 'vf-ui-color'
//   A proposal from Stu:
//   - We keep vf-colors, and consider it the brand “theme colour stack” We stick with the set-color mixin for these.
//   - We then have vf-ui-colors for things that are agnostic to EMBL, uniprot etc (the light grey and light yellow for example) and have a set-ui-color mixins for those things.
//   - This paves the way for any future theming required but keeps colours that will forever be the same consistent.

//   Ken: Yeah, I like that idea … `vf-colours` + an `embl-colours` that overrides some and adds more options that we need for EMBL.
//   Mark: Me too. Almost like ‘interface colours’ > ‘brand colours’ > ‘sub-brand colours’ > ‘whatever’
