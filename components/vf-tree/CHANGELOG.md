# Change Log

## 1.0.1

* removes right padding on nested list items so arrows align properly.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

* Added a little specificity to the `.vf-show-hide__button`  and `vf-tree__button` so that it didn't break. No changes except for when `vf-show-hide__button` and `.vf-tree__button` are declared we now have `.vf-button.vf-show-hide__button` and `.vf-button.vf-tree__button`.
