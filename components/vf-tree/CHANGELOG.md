## 2019-04-08

Added a little specificity to the `.vf-show-hide__button`  and `vf-tree__button` so that it didn't break. No changes except for when `vf-show-hide__button` and `.vf-tree__button` are declared we now have `.vf-button.vf-show-hide__button` and `.vf-button.vf-tree__button`.

## 0.0.2-alpha.0 (2019-10-23)

**Note:** Version bump only for package @visual-framework/vf-tree
