# EMBL ContentHub Loader Pattern

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fembl-content-hub-loader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fembl-content-hub-loader)

Use this pattern to remotely load markup and content from the central EMBL ContentHub, this particular pattern allows reuse and distribution of content ranging articles to navigation elements (such as a global footer).

Currently this is done as HTML imports (see the code example) + some JS. In the future other methods will be support (such as JSON).

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm][npm]. After [installing npm][install-npm], you can install `primer-buttons` with this command.

```

```

## Usage

```

_Make sure you import any requirements along with the modules._
