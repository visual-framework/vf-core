# EMBL ContentHub Loader component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fembl-content-hub-loader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fembl-content-hub-loader)

## About

Use this component to remotely load markup and content from the central EMBL ContentHub, this particular component allows reuse and distribution of content ranging articles to navigation elements (such as a global footer).

Currently this is done as HTML imports (see the code example) + some JS. In the future other methods will be support (such as JSON).

### Integrations

After loading from contentHub, this component will also invoke these functions on child content:

- `vf-banner/vf-banner`
- `vf-tabs/vf-tabs`
- `embl-conditional-edit/embl-conditional-edit`
- `embl-notifications/embl-notifications`

### Supported patterns 

See the [introductory text on the contentHub](https://content.embl.org/).

### Standard HTML import

Load a content and pattern through the contentHub:

```html
<link rel="import" href="https://www.embl.org/api/v1/pattern.html?filter-content-type=article&filter-id=580&pattern=node-body&source=contenthub" data-target="self" data-embl-js-content-hub-loader>
```

### Options

There are optional features specified by data attributes, looks like:

```html
<link rel="import" href="https://www.embl.org/api/v1/pattern.html?source=contenthub&pattern=embl-person-publications&limit=100&sort-field-value[changed]=DESC&orcid=0000-0002-2524-5026&source=contenthub" data-target="publications-block" data-embl-js-content-hub-loader-no-content="No publications were found." data-embl-js-content-hub-loader-no-content-hide=".publications-container" data-embl-js-content-hub-loader>
```

Breakdown:

- `data-target="publications-block"`: pass the class of an element to insert text into
- `data-embl-js-content-hub-loader-no-content="No publications were found."`: String to use if no results found, can also pass `true` to use default no match text
- `data-embl-js-content-hub-loader-no-content-hide=".publications-container"`: If no results, hide an element that matches this selector selector 
- `data-inject-class="vf-grid vf-grid__col-2" data-inject-class-target="ul"`: Inject class(es) to a an element inside the returned content
