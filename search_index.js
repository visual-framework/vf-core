{"id":"2", "title": "About the Visual Framework ", "text": "  About the Visual Framework Understanding life in the context of its environment The Visual Framework (VF) is designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on being sane defaults and implements its CSS in a way that will not interfere with your existing components that use Bootstrap, Angular, or something else. Tailored for life science websites. The Visual Framework address three major needs: Clarity the VF is highly customisable, but out of the box it has a highly usable look that builds in solid UX principles to increase comprehension and decrease cognitive load. Just because the scientific material is challenging, it doesn&apos;t mean using the website needs to be. Compatibility the VF won&apos;t break your other framework&apos;s CSS or JS, so bring Bootstrap, Foundation, React or Angular. With the VF components (and brand design) can be shared between sites without cross-contaminating other functionality. We achieve this by a CSS Modules-style approach: CSS: styling on HTML elements and only use namespaced classes, that is: Not this: .button {} or button {} or div.button {} Like this: .vf-button {} JavaScript: Use ours or bring your own We include only minimal JS in components and it&apos;s fully optional (just remove the JavaScript selectors). If you&apos;d rather use Angular or Bootstrap for your tabs, the Visual Framework won&apos;t get in the way, just remove data-vf-js-tabs from your markup. Componentisation Use only the portions you need. Use vf-core to build your CSS, JS dynamically based on the components you need, or bring your own build system.

Many problems are due to local develpment environment configuration, here&apos;s how to get your development back on track.Before creating a ticket or tossing your machine out the window, we&apos;ve found most issues can be sorted by one of the below commands and tips.  Common commands and tricks Run yarn install Your node_modules folder might not be up to date. Reset your project&apos;s build Sometimes a project&apos;s node_modules directory can become contaminated or out of sync: remove the local build: rm -rf node_modules you can also try rebuilding the lock file: rm yarn.lock reinstall: yarn install Don&apos;t npm install Visual Framework systems work faster and are tested using yarn install. If you run npm install you may encounter unexpected issues or node may become confused if you&apos;re switching between npm install and yarn install. Use gulp dev and not gulp vf-dev If you&apos;re getting an error building your CSS or JS, make sure you&apos;re running the correct command. gulp vf-dev should only be invoked from the command line when developing vf-core, for other projects run gulp dev. Rollback your components or vf-core version You might have an incombatibility between component versions or vf-core. If you&apos;ve recently updated, rollback version and re-run gulp dev. If that fixes issues, consult the component CHANGELOG.md files or read up on the vf-core release notes. Make sure there are symlinks inside your component directory In your local component directory, you should have symlinks to where you keep your Yarn-installed components, such as ./src/components/vf-core-components which points to ../../node_modules/@visual-framework/. Sometimes these folders are manually deleted and not replaced by git origin pull, but git reset --hard will -- you&#x2019;ll want to save any local changes first. Git reset, hard Your local files might be out of sync, stash your local changes elsewhere and run git reset --hard. Windows Windows has its own unique needs and section of tips. Use Windows Terminal Preview And within that we recommend using PowerShell. Here&apos;s how to install Terminal. Use Scoop for dependency management If you need to install, node, yarn and all the things, use scoop. Windows paths Windows need some extra love with path handling, this can usually be sorted within node and gulp by let myFixedPath = myPath.replace(/\\/g, &apos;/&apos;); Symlinks and Windows The Visual Framework utilises symlinks, these work fine on Windows but they will need to be initialised on your first git pull: Open PowerShell as an Administrator Delete the old symlink rm .\src\components\vf-core-components Recreate it cmd /c mklink /D .\src\components\vf-core-components ..\..\node_modules\@visual-framework\ Still stumped?

FAQ Is VF Core just a Bootstrap with a different theme? No. VF Core is an architecture to build extensible components that contain CSS/Sass, JS, Nunjuck templates, and image assets. You could use the VF Core to make a Bootstrap-style framework. I&#x2019;m a small research team, should I use VF Core? Yes, utilise the Visual Framework system with one of the above listed approaches. Does it have a specific look and feel? No. It has a default look out of the box, but it is fully customisable by altering the Design Tokens. Is it really ready for use today? Yes! Shouldn&#x2019;t I just use Bootstrap or Solution X? No, but yes &#x2026; do both, if you need to. This question involve the Visual Framework&apos;s architecture which addresses common issues with code sharing and compatibility with life science webistes.

{"id":"12", "title": "ebi-header-footer ", "text": "     EBI Header and Footer Component This provides support for using the EBI header and footer from the EBI VF 1.3. It provides the minimum ammount of legacy CSS to make the header and footer work while avoiding conflicts with other 2.0 styles. Install This repository is distributed with [npm][npm]. After [installing npm][install-npm], you can install ebi-header-footer with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/ebi-header-footer Note This component is not included in the default vf-component-rollup and will not be found in the default styles.css.

As such the component will use mostly legacy CSS from the existing v1.3 EBI VF. Version 2: Rewrite the EBI header and footer in v2.0 HTML and pull from the contentHub, then we can drop the legacy CSS and use pure v2.0 CSS. We can&apos;t yet do this as v1.3 is still the stable and supported solution for EBI sites, we will need to move a majority of sites to VF 2.0 before we can drop v1.3/js/script.js Usage The source files included are written in [Sass][sass] (scss) You can simply point your sass include-path at your node_modules directory and import it like this. @import @visual-framework/ebi-header-footer/index.scss ; Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules.

Usage User actions This component tracks three types of user engagement as actions in Google Analytics: General clicks in the browser as UI category standard elements like a button details form elements like input select textarea label Downloads of files as Downloads zip|exe|pdf|doc*|xls*|ppt*|mp3|txt|fasta Emails links as Email mailto: Explicit labels can be provided with data attributes: data-vf-analytics-label= A special label Meta tags Track dimensions: &lt;meta name= vf:page-type content= category;pageTypeHere &gt; How to add dimension to your property? https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/custom-dims-mets https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829?hl=en Page region tracking You can track the region of the page where an event occurs: &lt;div data-vf-google-analytics-region= main-content-area-OR-SOME-OTHER-NAME &gt; &lt;a href= //www.example.com &gt;My link here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Notes: region names should not be repeated on the same page nested regions are currently not fully supported Verbose logging &lt;body data-vf-google-analytics-verbose= true &gt; JavaScript You should import this component in ./components/vf-component-rollup/scripts.js or your other JS process: import { vfGaIndicateLoaded } from &apos;vf-analytics-google/vf-analytics-google&apos;; // Or import directly // import { vfGaIndicateLoaded } from &apos;../components/raw/vf-analytics-google/vf-analytics-google.js&apos;; let vfGaTrackOptions = { vfGaTrackPageLoad: true, vfGaTrackNetwork: { serviceProvider: &apos;dimension2&apos;, networkDomain: &apos;dimension3&apos;, networkType: &apos;dimension4&apos; } }; vfGaIndicateLoaded(vfGaTrackOptions); vfGaIndicateLoaded() is the primary function and awaits and checks to see if Google Analytics client side JS has loaded. If it does, sets &lt;body data-vf-google-analytics-loaded=&apos;true&apos;&gt; Options vfGaIndicateLoaded() accepts these options for object vfGaTrackOptions: Do not track the page load: vfGaTrackOptions.vfGaTrackPageLoad (defaults to true). If you set to false, the function will not track the initial page view. Useful if you track the initial page view with JavaScript in your HTML. Track the users network: vfGaTrackOptions.vfGaTrackNetwork As of February 2020 Google Analytics no longer tracks the network name of visitors A 3rd party tool enables this, follow the setup guide at https://ipmeta.io/instructions note there is no need to load https://ipmeta.io/plugin.js, this component includes it for you After configuring your property in Google Analytics, add the configuration below vfGaIndicateUnloaded() Utility method to invalidate prior GA check &lt;body data-vf-google-analytics-loaded=&apos;false&apos;&gt; vfGaTrackInteraction() Can be used to directly track events if you wish to use your own event handler. /** * This code tracks the user&apos;s clicks in various parts of the site and logs them as GA events. * * Dev note: * add class verbose-analytics to your body for a readout to console on clicks. * * @param {element} actedOnItem * @param {string} customEventName Event action * @example * jQuery( .analytics-content-footer ).on(&apos;mousedown&apos;, &apos;a, button&apos;, function(e) { * vfGaTrackInteraction(e.target,&apos;Content footer&apos;); * }); * / Install This repository is distributed with [npm][npm].

{"id":"32", "title": "vf-box ", "text": "     Box Component About The vf-box layout container can add spacing, a background color, a border, and text colours to an area of content. Usage A vf-box can be used in all layout components (vf-grid, vf-stack, embl-grid) and also inside of vf-content. For now vf-box is only designed to accept a heading and text (both have classes). The text node &#x2013; vf-box__text can also accept a link which will inherit the text colour. Options Is Link If you require the vf-box to link to a page you can do this by: Using .njk and .yml for content: if you are using .njk you only need to add a box_href to the data. Authoring in HTML: adding vf-box--is-link to the classes being used &lt;div vf-box vf-box--is-link &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;. adding the link inside of the title &lt;h3 vf-box__title &gt;&lt;a href= # vf-box__link &gt;A title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;. Design Variants There are currently two Design variants available. To add the appropriate level of design you can add a component&#x2013;level class: vf-box--easy vf-box--normal Themes note: you need a design variant set at the page (todo), container (todo), or component level to make use of the themes available to avoid any potential conflicts with code or unexpected results The vf-box component allows for global and component&#x2013;level theming so that it is customisable to your needs. To make use of the component&#x2013;level theming you will need to add a theme classname to the component. The theme classnames available are: vf-box-theme--primary vf-box-theme--secondary vf-box-theme--tertiary vf-box-theme--quaternary vf-box-theme--quinary Accessibility Do not use the themes vf-box-theme--qauternary or vf-box-theme--quinary with the design variant vf-box--easy as they do not conform to WCAG colour contrast ratio specifications.

After installing npm, you can install the vf-box with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-box The source files included are written in Sass(scss).

{"id":"37", "title": "vf-cluster ", "text": "     The Cluster Layout Component The vf-cluster is a layout component that can be used when we need to give various content items (of indeterment sizes) an equaly spaced layout on the page that can respond to the browsers viewport width. The main use case for vf-cluster is to be mainly used when something the available grid systems are too &apos;rigid&apos; because of the different widths of the content. Installation This repository is distributed with npm. After installing npm and yarn, you can install vf-cluster with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-cluster Sass/CSS The source files included are written in scss syntax of Sass. You can point your sass include-path at your node_modules directory and import it like this. @import @visual-framework/vf-cluster/index.scss ; Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. Development Integration Eleventy To use the vf-cluster component we make use of the @extends directive from Nunjucks to &apos;wrap&apos; around the content we want this layout component to render. Requirements To use the vf-cluster component you must be using vX.X.X of vf-eleventy. Code In the .njk file you are wanting to use the vf-cluster you must include the following code to &apos;extend&apos; the file with the vf-cluster component. {% raw %} {% extends layout.cluster %} {% endraw %} You will then need to create a &apos;block&apos; to put the relevant content inside so that it renders within the vf-cluster layout when rendered. {% raw %} {% block cluster_content %} ... {% endblock %} {% endraw %} To make use of .yml to render the vf-cluster to the variant you wish to use, you will have to &apos;set&apos; the context in the .njk file. {% raw %} {% set context = cluster1 %} {% endraw %} note: cluster1 is an example, please pick your own semantic, readable context names With these set you can then add the relevant content as needed. WordPress Requirements To use the vf-cluster component you must be using vX.X.X of vf-wp. Variants There are four spacing variants and three alignment variants available for this component as well as an option to define the width of the vf-clusters children. custom property options default ", "tags": "", "url": "/components/vf-cluster/index.html"},

{"id":"46", "title": "vf-divider ", "text": "     Divider Component About The vf-divider component creates a horizontal dividing rule that can help separate containers of content or content inside of their containers. Install This component is distributed with npm. After installing npm, you can install the vf-divider with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-divider The source files included are written in Sass(scss). You can point your Sass include-path at your node_modules directory and import it like this. @import @visual-framework/vf-divider/index.scss ; Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. Usage The vf-divider component will be the width of if&apos;s container. So inside of &lt;body&gt; of your page it will be a maximum of 1300px. &lt;body vf-body &gt; &lt;hr vf-divider &gt; &lt;/body&gt; If you wish to have your vf-divider fit the whole width of the screen you can add the vf-u-fullbleed utility class along side it: &lt;hr vf-divider | vf-u-fullbleed &gt; This fills the width of the viewport but gives a inline (left and right) margin. You can customise the inline (left and right) margin if you wish by using the CSS custom property --context-margin--inline on the element: &lt;hr vf-divider | vf-u-fullbleed style= --context-margin--inline: 2rem; &gt;   Variants   Variant: Default live  Type: element  Nunjucks demo  {% render &apos;@vf-divider--default&apos;, { component-type : element } %}  Sample output     Sample output as HTML  &lt;hr vf-divider &gt;   Variant: Fullbleed live  Type: element  Nunjucks demo  {% render &apos;@vf-divider--fullbleed&apos;, { component-type : element , override_class : vf-u-fullbleed } %}  Sample output     Sample output as HTML  &lt;hr vf-divider | vf-u-fullbleed &gt;   Variant: Fullbleed Custom live  Type: element  Nunjucks demo  {% render &apos;@vf-divider--fullbleed-custom&apos;, { component-type : element , override_class : vf-u-fullbleed , context_margin__inline : 3rem } %}  Sample output     Sample output as HTML  &lt;hr vf-divider | vf-u-fullbleed style= --context-margin--inline: 3rem; &gt;  Assets Nunjucks template Config CHANGELOG.md vf-divider.css vf-divider.scss File system location: components/vf-divider A toolkit to quickly build better life science websites.

{"id":"47", "title": "vf-embed ", "text": "     vf-embed Component Usage The vf-embed component can currently give two different aspect ratios by adding a class variant. You can also define a max-width for the embed if needed. Nunjucks Props To avoid any mistyping, forgetfulness, and to aid in future proofing the component. We are using &apos;pseudo props&apos; in nunjucks to determine which CSS selectors to use. All props do nothing unless included in your data for the component. Props available vf_embed_max_width: required a number and CSS unit to give vf-embed as maximum width. This number is applied to the CSS custom property --vf-embed-max-width. vf_embed_variant_16x9: if set to true (vf_embed_variant_16x9: true) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--16x9 to vf-embed. vf_embed_variant_4x3: if set to true (vf_embed_variant_4x3: true) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--4x3 to vf-embed. vf_embed_variant_custom: if set to true (&apos;vf_embed_variant_custom: true&apos;) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--custom-ratio to vf-embed. When this is applied the two CSS custom properties --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x and --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y can be used to define the X and Y ratio. Aspect Ratios Aspect Ratios available are 16x9 and 4x3 or one defined using CSS custom properties. Class Variants vf-embed--16x9 for embedable content that is has an aspect ratio of 16x9. vf-embed--4x3 for embedable content that is has an aspect ratio of 4x3. vf-embed--custom-ratio for embedable content that requires a unique aspect ratio. Custom Ratios If you use vf-embed--custom-ratio you will need to set the X and Y ratio using CSS Custom Properties. The CSS Custom Properties available when using vf-embed--custom-ratio are: --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x for the X value. --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y for the Y value. For example. If you need an aspect ratio of 11x6 your HTML output could look like: &lt;div vf-embed vf-embed--custom-ratio style= --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x: 11; --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y: 6 &gt; &lt;!-- embedded content goes here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Max Width You can also set a max width for the vf-emded. If you do this in the nunjucks file with the key of maxWidth: the nunjucks template will output an inline style onto the vf-embed. You can add this however fits best your product (in the :root, in a stylesheet, etc). If you do not set a --vf-embed-max-width value then the component is set to a maximum width of 100%. For example. If you need a vf-embed with the aspect ratio of 16x9 but with a maximum width of 400px your HTML out could look like: &lt;div vf-embed vf-embed--16x9 style= --vf-embed-max-width: 400px &gt; &lt;!-- embedded content goes here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Install This repository is distributed with [npm][https://www.npmjs.com/].

{"id":"50", "title": "vf-figure ", "text": "     Figure Component Usage The vf-figure componet defaults to give the image a maximum width of 100% so that it can be placed inside of a grid (like vf-grid) and fill the space of the grid item(s) that have been allocated by its parent. If you need to specify the width of the component you can use the CSS custom property --vf-figure__width which will override the width in the CSS. The vf-figure component also has some alignment class selectors available. Class Selectors vf-figure--align: required to align the component depending on where it is needed. This class also changes the width of the image to auto but can still be overriden with --vf-figure__width. The class also changes the display to display: table so that we can confine the figcaption inside of the figure HTML element without any overflow. vf-figure--align-inline-start: This class adds float: left;. vf-figure--align-inline-end: This class adds float: right;. vf-figure--align-inline-centered: This class adds margin: 0 auto;. Nunjucks Props To avoid any mistyping, forgetfulness, and to aid in future proofing the component. We are using &apos;pseudo props&apos; in nunjucks to determine which CSS selectors to use. All props do nothing unless included in your data for the component. Props available vf_figure__align_inline_start: if set to true (vf_figure__align_inline_start: true) it will apply the class selectors vf-figure--align vf-figure--align-inline-start to vf-figure. vf_figure__align_inline_end: if set to true (vf_figure__align_inline_end: true) it will apply the class selectors vf-figure--align vf-figure--align-inline-end to vf-figure. vf_figure__align_inline_centered: if set to true (vf_figure__align_inline_centered: true) it will apply the class selectors vf-figure--align vf-figure--align-inline-centered to vf-figure.

So what worked best over 2017 and what can I learn from this? My basic goals for VF&#x2019;s social media are to build community and develop a shared understanding of who we as an organisation are. Consequently, I care about what resonates on the different social sites much more than driving traffic back to Visual Framework websites, although traffic is obviously a by-product.

Use in vf-eleventy To use this component in a vf-eleventy project you will need to set the context for the content to pass through from the nunjucks file associated yaml file and include it. {% set context == UniqueContextName %} {% include containers.vf_intro %} note: due to how nunjucks handles special characters we have remove the @ at sign and need to replace the - hyphen used for an _ underscore to &amp;lcub;% include &amp;rcub; a component or container. As shown above instead of writing something like &amp;lcub;% include contaienrs.@vf-intro &amp;rcub; we need to type &amp;lcub;% include vf_intro &amp;rcub; You may wish to make use of some of your projects side specifc data or content. To do this you will need to set the relevant items of content before you {% include ... %} the component. Note: If you also declare this content in the .yml file it will take precedence over the inlined code. For example. If you wanted to make use of your projects siteConfig information. You can write out the inclusion of the component in you pages .njk file like so: {% set context == UniqueContextName %} {% set vf_intro_heading == siteConfig.siteInformation.short_description %} {% include containers.intro %} Content The vf-intro allows for a variet of text. content type variable description ", "tags": "", "url": "/components/vf-intro/index.html"},

{"id":"69", "title": "vf-masthead ", "text": "     Masthead Component About Background Colours By Default, the vf-masthead is white text on a black background except if it is the title block variant where the text will be black on a white background with an overall black background. This can be effected by either having a global theme class applied to a parent (usually on body) where the colours determined by the theme name will cascade into this component. The other way is to apply a component specific class that effects the colours. Theme Variants available are: vf-masthead-theme--primary vf-masthead-theme--secondary vf-masthead-theme--tertiary There is also a variant that allows for a background image - vf-masthead--has-image as well as a variant that allows for the text to be in a block of white (with the text being black) - vf-masthead--with-title-block. notes: If you are overriding the background or foreground (text) colour make sure you are: using a colour from the Visual Framework testing to be sure that the contrast ratio meets accessibility guidelines Background Image Size The maximum dimensions for a background image is 1224px wide with a height of 150px. As more and more displays are what we term &apos;retina&apos; they need to be twice the width and height to look crisp. Images that are used for mastheads need to have dimensions of 2448px by 300px. Text Colour When using a background image we have to determine the best text colour to meet the contrast ratio from our accessibility guidelines. We do this using JavaScript and the background image filename. In creating the background images for mastheads each image filename needs to have it&apos;s most dominate colour added as a hexadecimal code. masthead-background-image--00EF00.png The JavaScript looks for this hexidecimal colour code and mathematically works out the correct text colour to use. The CSS custom property --local-theme-fg-color is then applied in the style tag of the component. &lt;style&gt; &lt;div vf-masthead vf-masthead--has-image style= background-image: var(--vf-masthead__bg-image); --local-theme-fg-color:#FFFFFF; data-vf-js-masthead= &gt; &lt;/style&gt; If JavaScript is disabled, or if it doesn&apos;t load with the page. The masthead will default to the background colour. Browser Support CSS Custom Properties do not work in older versions of Internet Explorer. We provide a default look for the masthead for these browser which is a white foreground colour (for text) on a green background. However, this can be overriden if needed using the Sass variables. Install This component is distributed with npm. After installing npm, you can install the vf-masthead with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-masthead The source files included are written in Sass(scss).

{"id":"85", "title": "vf-stack ", "text": "     vf-stack Component Usage This can be used to set the flow of child components. Some (and soon all) vf-core components will come without any margin spacing (this is to avoid adding margins where it is not needed). You can add the vf-stack class name to existing containers (like vf-content) or containers you create yourself in your codebase. Note: vf-grid (1.0.0) and embl-grid (2.0.1) now automaticaly add gaps to their child elements as needed. So you should not use vf-stack alongside these. Install This repository is distributed with [npm][https://www.npmjs.com/]. After [installing npm][https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm] and yarn, you can install vf-stack with this command. $ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-stack Sass/CSS If your component uses Sass: The source files included are written in Sass (scss) You can simply point your sass include-path at your node_modules directory and import it like this. @import @visual-framework/vf-stack/index.scss ; Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules. Variants We use CSS custom properties to control this vertical rhythm. For browsers that do not support CSS custom properties (IE 11) we provide a default value of 1rem so that child components get some spacing.

{"id":"92", "title": "vf-u-fullbleed ", "text": "     Full Bleed Utility About This utility class allows you to make a container take the full width of the viewport available but keep the content set to the maximum width of the grid. As we should be relying on vf-grid, embl-grid, or a container to make sure the content is centered with a maximum width of 76.5em we use the ::before pseudo element to allow the background colour to &apos;bleed out&apos; and fill any space avaiable. For this to work you need to make sure that the parent element you place the class .vf-u-fullbleed has to have a background colour. This can be done either by: using a container component that has a defined background colour. using a background colour utility class. For example: &lt;section vf-content | embl-grid embl-grid--has-centered-content | vf-u-fullbleed | vf-u-background-color--blue &gt; ... &lt;/section&gt; Notes: Browsers running on Windows tend to have scrollbars always showing. There is a small bug with the vw unit where the calculations leading to 100vw could create a horizontal scroll bar. To avoid this, without using JavaScript. We need to apply the CSS rule of overflow-x: hidden; to a parent element. As we are making all components their own installable package we have added the required CSS to this component rather than relying on additional packages. Making use of Sass @at-root directive and defining what element to add the rule too. The variable used for this is $vf-u-fullbleed-parent. This is set to body as the default but can be overridden in your projects overriding Sass variables file (which needs to be near the top of the import file). .vf-u-fullbleed { $vf-u-fullbleed-parent: body !defualt; ... @at-root #{$vf-u-fullbleed-parent} { position: relative; } } This has been test with sites using VF1.x and no problems have been found.

While the effects of the environment on living systems have been well studied at the level of individual organisms and populations, many of the underlying molecular processes remain obscure. We now have the tools and technologies to explore these processes, allowing us to understand life in its natural context from the level of molecules to whole ecosystems. This new understanding will be critically important if we are to tackle societal challenges such as environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, climate change, and threats to human health such as the emergence of new epidemics.EMBL&#x2019;s new transversal research themes will enable us to realise this vision of understanding life in context. The transversal research themes will be highly interdisciplinary and will encourage dynamic internal and external collaborations. These themes will enable transformative discoveries by bringing together experts in fields such as ecology, epidemiology, toxicology, zoology, population genetics, engineering, and mathematical theory. There will be strong support for building collaborations within each theme, as well as with the wider scientific community, not only to enable scientific discovery but also to build these themes across the EMBL sites.

We&apos;ve also revised our publishing procedure to more frequently ship tagged releases the CDN (a la: https://assets.emblstatic.net/vf/v2.2.0/css/styles.css). And we plan to better document how to find the latest tagged release, and when you should build your own CSS and JS from source. Ways to stay updated Join the VF Slack group Use a CI tool like Dependabot to get automatic pull requests Follow the RSS feed How we&apos;re (partly) automating blog updates We&apos;re using git to echo all the changes between the last releases with this git command: git show -U --raw $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags $(git rev-list --tags --skip=1 --max-count=1))..$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)) --raw --output=tools/vf-component-library/src/site/updates/$(date +%F)-component-updates.md -- **/CHANGELOG.md It dumps the changes into a time-stamped Markdown file which our Eleventy-based component library turns into a blog post. We run this as an aliased command: yarn run releasenotes The file then needs some manual massaging which we plan to further automate in the future: Insert templated frontmatter Rewrite the git output and link accorignly, in this format: ### [vf-summary](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/components/vf-summary/) 1.3.1 commit [999f4cf9671afab790735150dd21c2040c3968b3](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/commit/999f4cf9671afab790735150dd21c2040c3968b3) - adds &apos;grid-template-areas&apos; CSS for `--has-image` variant so you can use it with a `-thumbnail` class.

If you need the user to write more longer pieces of text then make use of &lt;textarea vf-form__textarea &gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;. Make sure your text inputs have the relevant labels (using &lt;label vf-fprm__label &gt;&lt;/label&gt;) and helper text (using &lt;p vf-form__helper &gt;&lt;/p&gt;). If your input is required there is also CSS used to style the input box when it is not completed. Make use of the label available if the form is sent to the server for validation (using &lt;p vf-form__label vf-form__label--required &gt;...&lt;/p&gt;). vf-form__label All form items need to include a label (using &lt;label vf-fprm__label &gt;&lt;/label&gt;). These should be as short as possible. If you need to include more details use helper text (using &lt;p vf-form__helper &gt;&lt;/p&gt;). If your input is required use the component &lt;p vf-form__label vf-form__label--required &gt;...&lt;/p&gt;. vf-form__helper If you need to include more descriptive explanations of what the input requires make use of the component &lt;span vf-form__helper &gt;&lt;/span&gt; where you can add more text. If your form is has any type of validation (either on the client or server) you can make use of vf-form__helper--error to help with inputs that do not have the correct content. vf-form__fieldset Use the component vf-form__fieldset when there is a relationship betweent form inputs. This maybe a group of text inputs or a group of checkboxes or radio inputs. Or a variation of all. The first HTML element that needs to be inside of &lt;fieldset vf-form__fieldset &gt; needs to be a legend - &lt;legend vf-form__legend &gt;Describing the group&lt;/legend&gt; More documentation is to follow.

Type of component: We use a variation of the atomic design methodology, read about the differences here. We use: elements, blocks, and containers. an element would be a heading, or a button a block would be a teaser, or a search form a container would be a group of teasers Name of component: Go for something simple and obvious (todo: we need a guide/documentation on how we name things). Don&apos;t worry about namespacing and prefixing, the tooling will take care of this. NPM package: If you&apos;re making something interesting (probably not an &apos;element&apos;), then saying &apos;yes&apos; will allow the component to be shared as an optional part of the framework on NPM.

At the lower level there are components which are a type of ingredient used to assembl into the higher level patterns that are richer templates with usability guidance.

Here&apos;s how: Clone vf-core git clone https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core.git Move to the directory cd vf-core You probably want the develop branch (or your new feature branch) git checkout develop Install fractal You might need to use sudo. yarn global add @frctl/fractal Download all the things yarn install Run a dev build and open in your browser gulp vf-dev Developing on Windows? The Visual Framework is primairly developed on Mac and Linux environments, but it is also intended to be Windows 10 compatible. We test and support Windows 10 using scoop We don&apos;t test using Windows Subsytem for Linux, thought it should work fine or better than native Windows Windows users will also want to consult the troubleshooting on Windows Last updated on 18 Mar 2020  A toolkit to quickly build better life science websites.

{"id":"134", "title": "Sass and CSS guidelines ", "text": "  Sass and CSS guidelines CSS Naming conventions Components in the Visual Framework follow the BEM naming convention. .component { } .component__item { } .component--alternative { } Namespacing We namespace all universal components with a prefix of vf-. This ensures that the component will not break an existing codebase. .vf-component { } This allows the Visual Framework to also include team specific components that are owned by those teams. .embl-grid { } Design Patterns and Components The Visual Framework makes use of Atomic Design-style concepts to define components. Instead of using Atoms, Molecules, Organisms the Visual Framework uses the terms Elements, Blocks, and Containers. In code we do not include further prefixes for the Visual Frameworks version of Atomic Design. Instead we rely on other components to help determine what is an Element, a Block, or a Container. Elements An Element: headings, lists, buttons, dividers, links, etc. are named after what they are semantically. .vf-text { } .vf-text-heading--3 { } Blocks A Block: headers, lists, etc. are a single purpose design component that is also named after what it does or where it would go as part of a document structure. It makes use of Elements in the HTML where needed. .vf-breadcrumbs { } .vf-page-header { } In the HTML the Visual Framework makes use of | to separate Element classes from Block classes &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-heading vf-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-heading vf-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; Mixes When creating components you may find that a block you are wanting to use needs specific styling within it&apos;s parent. To do this we make use of BEM&apos;s mixes. Where not only do you include the relevant classnames for the block but add an additional class that includes the parent classname. For example, the page header has two text nodes: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-text vf-text--heading-3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-text vf-text--heading-4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; The span needs to be a grey colour instead of the default black so we add a mix class to it. Instead of including the elements and relying on the parent class (.vf-page-header) to alter the styling, writing our HTML like this: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-text vf-text-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-text vf-text-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; We add component specific mix classes to the h1 and span to be able to style them: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-text vf-text-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-text vf-text-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; Notes It is good practice when creating a component to include a mix for any child element used. All mix classes should be written in the parents .scss file. So for the vf-page-header example we would write the required CSS in that component&apos;s .scss file rather than in the vf-text.scss file. Containers A Container is a horizontal slice of a page that contains Blocks and Elements. A Container is named after its purpose rather than an abstract concept. &lt;div vf-intro &gt; &lt;h1 vf-intro__heading &gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p vf-lede &gt;Cancer is a generic term for lots of different diseases in which cells divide many more times than usual. This abnormal growth can affect many cell types in almost any part of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p vf-intro__text &gt;Cancer is a multi-stage process. Normal cells begin to divide abnormally, spreading beyond their normal boundaries, and abnormal tissue growth causes swellings called tumours to form. Tumours can be benign &#x2013; with no harmful effect on the body &#x2013; or malignant, invading healthy tissue and interfering with normal bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p vf-intro__text &gt;There are more than 100 types of cancer and symptoms vary depending on the type. &lt;a href= JavaScript:Void(0); &gt;Read more about Cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; How to write your Sass A core principle of the Visual Framework is simple integration into workflows. Accordingly, we use Sass in this project but keep it close to CSS structure so that it&apos;s easily understandable. Nesting Sass allows Nesting of CSS. This is a very nice feature but can be over used and abused. To stop this getting out of hand you should only nest media queries, pseudo classes and where referencing the parent makes sense (things like .vf-no-js and modernizr classes). For example, in Sass: a { text-decoration: none; &amp;:hover { text-decoration: underline; } @media (min-width: 800px) { font-weight: 700; } .vf-no-js &amp; { color: blue; } } And the compiled CSS: a { text-decoration: none; } a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } @media (min-width: 800px) { a { font-weight: 700; } } .vf-no-js a { color: blue; } Variables Variables in Sass allow you to reuse things like font stacks, colors and margins etc. Within the UI Pattern Library there is a file within the global folder called _variables.scss where these are defined. If you find yourself repeating a declaration in your CSS a few times it may be worth adding a new variable for this. Try to be as abstract as you can when naming it. For example rather than write $tab-navigation-padding: 10px; and $tab-card-padding: 10px; consider writing $tab-padding or $padding-small; so that it can be used elsewhere without confusion. Mixins By default there are only a limited amount of mixins in the UI Pattern Library. They are more to make writing code easier than doing anything fancy. If you take a look at the _mixin.scss file that&apos;s in the global folder in the scss folder there is a mixin that will make writing media queries, responsive typography and placeholders&apos;s easier when using a component. As this UI Pattern Library can make it&apos;s way into various aspects of the company mixins should be kept to a minimum so that it is easy to understand what they do. Working on a project When you&apos;re working on a project you may need to make notes for things to get back to, or things that are&apos;t done and could change. You should use Sass comments for this. If you have written some code that needs something fixed or added to then add a comment prefixed with @todo. Something l Rike this: // @todo fix height issue If you have written some code that may change as it maybe something that gets pushed back into the patter library or something that may change by design use @maychange. It would look something like this: // @maychange this shade of blue may change in next design overhaul Your code editor can help you find these when mopping up before a project goes live.

{"id":"135", "title": "Governance of the Visual Framework ", "text": "  Governance of the Visual Framework The Visual Framework 2.0 is an open source project meant for the wider life science community, so the maintainers aim to be transparent about what goes in vf-core, what doesn&apos;t and why decisions are made. The guiding spirit of the Visual Framework can be summed up as: Instead of a quick way to implement one look and feel, the Visual Framework is a way to quickly implement the look and feel needed for your content, data, users and organisation. More background here. What goes in Code committed to vf-core should meet these measures: Not lock you into a particular brand look and feel Be useful to many organisations Be mindful of constraints and use cases common for life science content and data Be compatible with a variety of frontend solutions Be modular and extensible Where ideas are proposed and discussed Ideas are typically discussed on chat and GitHub issues and decisions are documented there. What&apos;s in decision We aim to capture: What was agreed Why it was agreed Forever-hold-your-peace Who makes the decision In spirit, the community but in practice that falls to the maintainers and those asking for change. Who are the maintainers? Currently (as of April 2019) it&apos;s limited to EMBL and EMBL-EBI developers, but we aim to expand this into a consultative group after beta.1 in late spring/summer 2019.

{"id":"136", "title": "JavaScript guidelines ", "text": "  JavaScript guidelines Just enough JavaScript The Visual Framework isn&apos;t intended as a general-purpose JavaScript solution, however we know it is helpful that a minimal amount of basic functionality is supported. All components are provided as functional solutions, so where JavaScript is required (such as tabs) there is a fully functional set of JavaScript bundled and available in: vf-tabs.js and scripts.js An opt-in philosophy But we know many users would prefer to use their own JavaScript tooling for all -- or some -- components on a case-by-case basis. Why? As Adobe&apos;s Spectrum CSS puts it: We have found that JavaScript is where a framework or library quickly becomes opinionated and stops being easy to use with or across other frameworks. To avoid this problem, Spectrum CSS avoids implementation details that require JavaScript. Likewise we don&apos;t require the use of the Visual Framework JavaScript, instead the behviour can be optionally invoke per-component with JavaScript data selectors. So to activate the Visual Framework JavaScript for vf-tabs we add data-vf-js-tabs and data-vf-js-tabs-content, like so: &lt;div vf-tabs &gt; &lt;ul vf-tabs__list data-vf-js-tabs&gt; &lt;li vf-tabs__item &gt; &lt;a vf-tabs__link href= #vf-tabs__section--10 &gt;Second tab set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li vf-tabs__item &gt; &lt;a vf-tabs__link href= #vf-tabs__section--11 &gt;Tab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div vf-tabs-content data-vf-js-tabs-content&gt; &lt;section vf-tabs__section id= vf-tabs__section--10 &gt; &lt;h2&gt;Section 10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section vf-tabs__section id= vf-tabs__section--11 &gt; &lt;h2&gt;Section 11&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Leaving these data selectors off will cause vf-tabs.js to simply ignore the tabs. Naming The name of your selector should follow your component&apos;s name, plus an additional -js- prefix. So: vf-tabs = data-vf-js-tabs vf-messages = data-vf-js-messages mycompany-modal = data-mycompany-js-modal Last updated on 9 Apr 2019  A toolkit to quickly build better life science websites.
