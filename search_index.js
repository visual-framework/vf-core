{"id":"2", "title": "About the Visual Framework ", "text": "  About the Visual Framework The Visual Framework (VF) is designed with the needs of life science websites and services. It goes beyond guidance for tables, graphs, data-heavy typography and focuses on being sane defaults and implements its CSS in a way that will not interfere with your existing components that use Bootstrap, Angular, or something else. Tailored for life science websites. The Visual Framework address three major needs: Clarity the VF is highly customisable, but out of the box it has a highly usable look that builds in solid UX principles to increase comprehension and decrease cognitive load. Just because the scientific material is challenging, it doesn&apos;t mean using the website needs to be. Compatibility the VF won&apos;t break your other framework&apos;s CSS or JS, so bring Bootstrap, Foundation, React or Angular. With the VF components (and brand design) can be shared between sites without cross-contaminating other functionality. We achieve this by a CSS Modules-style approach: CSS: styling on HTML elements and only use namespaced classes, that is: Not this: .button {} or button {} or div.button {} Like this: .vf-button {} JavaScript: Use ours or bring your own We include only minimal JS in components and it&apos;s fully optional (just remove the JavaScript selectors). If you&apos;d rather use Angular or Bootstrap for your tabs, the Visual Framework won&apos;t get in the way, just remove data-vf-js-tabs from your markup. Componentisation Use only the portions you need. Use vf-core to build your CSS, JS dynamically based on the components you need, or bring your own build system.

Many problems are due to local develpment environment configuration, here&apos;s how to get your development back on track.Before creating a ticket or tossing your machine out the window, we&apos;ve found most issues can be sorted by one of the below commands and tips.  Common commands and tricks Run yarn install Your node_modules folder might not be up to date. Reset your project&apos;s build Sometimes a project&apos;s node_modules directory can become contaminated or out of sync: remove the local build: rm -rf node_modules you can also try rebuilding the lock file: rm yarn.lock reinstall: yarn install Don&apos;t npm install Visual Framework systems work faster and are tested using yarn install. If you run npm install you may encounter unexpected issues or node may become confused if you&apos;re switching between npm install and yarn install. Use gulp dev and not gulp vf-dev If you&apos;re getting an error building your CSS or JS, make sure you&apos;re running the correct command. gulp vf-dev should only be invoked from the command line when developing vf-core, for other projects run gulp dev. Rollback your components or vf-core version You might have an incombatibility between component versions or vf-core. If you&apos;ve recently updated, rollback version and re-run gulp dev. If that fixes issues, consult the component CHANGELOG.md files or read up on the vf-core release notes. Make sure there are symlinks inside your component directory In your local component directory, you should have symlinks to where you keep your Yarn-installed components, such as ./src/components/vf-core-components which points to ../../node_modules/@visual-framework/. Sometimes these folders are manually deleted and not replaced by git origin pull, but git reset --hard will -- you&#x2019;ll want to save any local changes first. Git reset, hard Your local files might be out of sync, stash your local changes elsewhere and run git reset --hard. Windows Windows has its own unique needs and section of tips. Use Windows Terminal Preview And within that we recommend using PowerShell. Here&apos;s how to install Terminal. Use Scoop for dependency management If you need to install, node, yarn and all the things, use scoop. Windows paths Windows need some extra love with path handling, this can usually be sorted within node and gulp by let myFixedPath = myPath.replace(/\\/g, &apos;/&apos;); Symlinks and Windows The Visual Framework utilises symlinks, these work fine on Windows but they will need to be initialised on your first git pull: Open PowerShell as an Administrator Delete the old symlink rm .\src\components\vf-core-components Recreate it cmd /c mklink /D .\src\components\vf-core-components ..\..\node_modules\@visual-framework\ Still stumped?

FAQ Is VF Core just a Bootstrap with a different theme? No. VF Core is an architecture to build extensible components that contain CSS/Sass, JS, Nunjuck templates, and image assets. You could use the VF Core to make a Bootstrap-style framework. I&#x2019;m a small research team, should I use VF Core? Yes, utilise the Visual Framework system with one of the above listed approaches. Does it have a specific look and feel? No. It has a default look out of the box, but it is fully customisable by altering the Design Tokens. Is it really ready for use today? Yes! Shouldn&#x2019;t I just use Bootstrap or Solution X? No, but yes &#x2026; do both, if you need to.

{"id":"33", "title": "vf-box ", "text": "   Box      The vf-box layout container can add spacing, a background color, a border, and text colours to an area of content. Usage A vf-box can be used in all layout components (vf-grid, vf-stack, embl-grid) and also inside of vf-content. For now vf-box is only designed to accept a heading and text (both have classes). The text node &#x2013; vf-box__text can also accept a link which will inherit the text colour. Is Link option If you require the vf-box to link to a page you can do this by: Using .njk and .yml for content: if you are using .njk you only need to add a box_href to the data. Authoring in HTML: adding vf-box--is-link to the classes being used &lt;div vf-box vf-box--is-link &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;. adding the link inside of the title &lt;h3 vf-box__title &gt;&lt;a href= # vf-box__link &gt;A title&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;. Design Variants There are currently two Design variants available. To add the appropriate level of design you can add a component&#x2013;level class: vf-box--easy vf-box--normal Themes note: you need a design variant set at the page (todo), container (todo), or component level to make use of the themes available to avoid any potential conflicts with code or unexpected results The vf-box component allows for global and component&#x2013;level theming so that it is customisable to your needs. To make use of the component&#x2013;level theming you will need to add a theme classname to the component. The theme classnames available are: vf-box-theme--primary vf-box-theme--secondary vf-box-theme--tertiary vf-box-theme--quaternary vf-box-theme--quinary Accessibility Do not use the themes vf-box-theme--qauternary or vf-box-theme--quinary with the design variant vf-box--easy as they do not conform to WCAG colour contrast ratio specifications.

{"id":"48", "title": "vf-embed ", "text": "   Embed      The vf-embed component can currently give two different aspect ratios by adding a class variant. You can also define a max-width for the embed if needed. Usage Nunjucks Props To avoid any mistyping, forgetfulness, and to aid in future proofing the component. We are using &apos;pseudo props&apos; in nunjucks to determine which CSS selectors to use. All props do nothing unless included in your data for the component. Props available vf_embed_max_width: required a number and CSS unit to give vf-embed as maximum width. This number is applied to the CSS custom property --vf-embed-max-width. vf_embed_variant_16x9: if set to true (vf_embed_variant_16x9: true) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--16x9 to vf-embed. vf_embed_variant_4x3: if set to true (vf_embed_variant_4x3: true) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--4x3 to vf-embed. vf_embed_variant_custom: if set to true (&apos;vf_embed_variant_custom: true&apos;) it will apply the class selector vf-embed--custom-ratio to vf-embed. When this is applied the two CSS custom properties --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x and --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y can be used to define the X and Y ratio. Aspect Ratios Aspect Ratios available are 16x9 and 4x3 or one defined using CSS custom properties. Class Variants vf-embed--16x9 for embedable content that is has an aspect ratio of 16x9. vf-embed--4x3 for embedable content that is has an aspect ratio of 4x3. vf-embed--custom-ratio for embedable content that requires a unique aspect ratio. Custom Ratios If you use vf-embed--custom-ratio you will need to set the X and Y ratio using CSS Custom Properties. The CSS Custom Properties available when using vf-embed--custom-ratio are: --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x for the X value. --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y for the Y value. For example. If you need an aspect ratio of 11x6 your HTML output could look like: &lt;div vf-embed vf-embed--custom-ratio style= --vf-embed-custom-ratio-x: 11; --vf-embed-custom-ratio-y: 6 &gt; &lt;!-- embedded content goes here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Max Width You can also set a max width for the vf-emded. If you do this in the nunjucks file with the key of maxWidth: the nunjucks template will output an inline style onto the vf-embed. You can add this however fits best your product (in the :root, in a stylesheet, etc). If you do not set a --vf-embed-max-width value then the component is set to a maximum width of 100%. For example. If you need a vf-embed with the aspect ratio of 16x9 but with a maximum width of 400px your HTML out could look like: &lt;div vf-embed vf-embed--16x9 style= --vf-embed-max-width: 400px &gt; &lt;!-- embedded content goes here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  Installation info This repository is distributed with [npm][https://www.npmjs.com/].

{"id":"51", "title": "vf-figure ", "text": "   Visual Framework Figure      The vf-figure componet defaults to give the image a maximum width of 100% so that it can be placed inside of a grid (like vf-grid) and fill the space of the grid item(s) that have been allocated by its parent. Usage If you need to specify the width of the component you can use the CSS custom property --vf-figure__width which will override the width in the CSS. The vf-figure component also has some alignment class selectors available. Class Selectors vf-figure--align: required to align the component depending on where it is needed. This class also changes the width of the image to auto but can still be overriden with --vf-figure__width. The class also changes the display to display: table so that we can confine the figcaption inside of the figure HTML element without any overflow. vf-figure--align-inline-start: This class adds float: left;. vf-figure--align-inline-end: This class adds float: right;. vf-figure--align-inline-centered: This class adds margin: 0 auto;. Nunjucks Props To avoid any mistyping, forgetfulness, and to aid in future proofing the component. We are using &apos;pseudo props&apos; in nunjucks to determine which CSS selectors to use.

Usage A Simple Grid is written to go from single column, to two column, to their respective column count depending on the size of the viewport. You can define the number of columns with a modifier class. Do Not Use with any component that uses the &lt;table&gt; HTML element as this breaks built-in browser accessibility for screen readers etc. Currently (16/03/20) The vf-grid is expecting to be a parent of vf-body.

So what worked best over 2017 and what can I learn from this? My basic goals for VF&#x2019;s social media are to build community and develop a shared understanding of who we as an organisation are. Consequently, I care about what resonates on the different social sites much more than driving traffic back to Visual Framework websites, although traffic is obviously a by-product.

This is is what it looks like: &lt;script nomodule src= https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default &gt;&lt;/script&gt; In effect, this provides better support to Internet Explorer and very old versions of Chrome, FireFox and Safari. Future plans In the future we may support passing parameters to the NJK template to load various mixes of polyfills.  Installation info This repository is distributed with npm.

{"id":"86", "title": "vf-stack ", "text": "   Stack      This can be used to set the flow of child components. Usage Some (and soon all) vf-core components will come without any margin spacing (this is to avoid adding margins where it is not needed). You can add the vf-stack class name to existing containers (like vf-content) or containers you create yourself in your codebase. Note: vf-grid (1.0.0) and embl-grid (2.0.1) now automaticaly add gaps to their child elements as needed. So you should not use vf-stack alongside these. Variants We use CSS custom properties to control this vertical rhythm. For browsers that do not support CSS custom properties (IE 11) we provide a default value of 1rem so that child components get some spacing. This value is overriden by browsers that understand CSS custom properties. variant name description ", "tags": "", "url": "/components/vf-stack/index.html"},

They can sample and test how tumours and drugs react and find unique molecular data to identify diseases. What does Cancer look like? Cancer is caused by uncontrolled cell division. These cells are tiny, but but can quickly add up and cancerous cells can look very different from healthy ones.

{"id":"93", "title": "vf-u-fullbleed ", "text": "   Full Bleed      This utility class allows you to make a container take the full width of the viewport available but keep the content set to the maximum width of the grid. Usage As we should be relying on vf-grid, embl-grid, or a container to make sure the content is centered with a maximum width of 76.5em we use the ::before pseudo element to allow the background colour to &apos;bleed out&apos; and fill any space avaiable. For this to work you need to make sure that the parent element you place the class .vf-u-fullbleed has to have a background colour. This can be done either by: using a container component that has a defined background colour. using a background colour utility class. For example: &lt;section vf-content | embl-grid embl-grid--has-centered-content | vf-u-fullbleed | vf-u-background-color--blue &gt; ... &lt;/section&gt; Notes: Browsers running on Windows tend to have scrollbars always showing. There is a small bug with the vw unit where the calculations leading to 100vw could create a horizontal scroll bar. To avoid this, without using JavaScript. We need to apply the CSS rule of overflow-x: hidden; to a parent element. As we are making all components their own installable package we have added the required CSS to this component rather than relying on additional packages. Making use of Sass @at-root directive and defining what element to add the rule too. The variable used for this is $vf-u-fullbleed-parent. This is set to body as the default but can be overridden in your projects overriding Sass variables file (which needs to be near the top of the import file). .vf-u-fullbleed { $vf-u-fullbleed-parent: body !defualt; ... @at-root #{$vf-u-fullbleed-parent} { position: relative; } } This has been test with sites using VF 1.x and no problems have been found. If you find an issue with this component being used alongside pages built with VF1.x please raise an issue.  Installation info This repository is distributed with npm.

While the effects of the environment on living systems have been well studied at the level of individual organisms and populations, many of the underlying molecular processes remain obscure. We now have the tools and technologies to explore these processes, allowing us to understand life in its natural context from the level of molecules to whole ecosystems. This new understanding will be critically important if we are to tackle societal challenges such as environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, climate change, and threats to human health such as the emergence of new epidemics.EMBL&#x2019;s new transversal research themes will enable us to realise this vision of understanding life in context. The transversal research themes will be highly interdisciplinary and will encourage dynamic internal and external collaborations. These themes will enable transformative discoveries by bringing together experts in fields such as ecology, epidemiology, toxicology, zoology, population genetics, engineering, and mathematical theory. There will be strong support for building collaborations within each theme, as well as with the wider scientific community, not only to enable scientific discovery but also to build these themes across the EMBL sites.   EMBL communications strategy 2018-2020 Cian O&apos;Luanaigh, 2 July 2018 at 12:55 pm This communications strategy outlines EMBL&#x2019;s vision, mission and goals.

Ways to stay updated Join the VF Slack group Use a CI tool like Dependabot to get automatic pull requests Follow the RSS feed How we&apos;re (partly) automating blog updates We&apos;re using git to echo all the changes between the last releases with this git command: git show -U --raw $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags $(git rev-list --tags --skip=1 --max-count=1))..$(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)) --raw --output=tools/vf-component-library/src/site/updates/$(date +%F)-component-updates.md -- **/CHANGELOG.md It dumps the changes into a time-stamped Markdown file which our Eleventy-based component library turns into a blog post. We run this as an aliased command: yarn run releasenotes The file then needs some manual massaging which we plan to further automate in the future: Insert templated frontmatter Rewrite the git output and link accorignly, in this format: ### [vf-summary](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/components/vf-summary/) 1.3.1 commit [999f4cf9671afab790735150dd21c2040c3968b3](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/commit/999f4cf9671afab790735150dd21c2040c3968b3) - adds &apos;grid-template-areas&apos; CSS for `--has-image` variant so you can use it with a `-thumbnail` class.

{"id":"119", "title": "Giving the Visual Framework better space ", "text": "  Giving the Visual Framework better space The Visual Framework&apos;s Design Tokens v2.0.0 release has a new way of defining the spacing tokens used for padding and margins for components and content. 20 Oct 2020 This is a breaking change, so we have given this a &#x2018;major bump&#x2019; in the npm package to v2.0.0. tl;dr? vf-u-margin__bottom--xs is now vf-u-margin__bottom--100 Where we were using &#x2019;t-shirt&#x2019; sizes to define a naming convention it stifled our ability to create newer spacing tokens. How do decide what to call the value that&#x2019;s between &#x2018;medium&#x2019; and &#x2018;large&#x2019;? We didn&#x2019;t think vf-spacing&#x2014;bigger-than-medium-but-smaller-than-large would work out so well. Now we use an incremental number to determine the spacing tokens. As we are moving closer to a more unified, consistent system of layout and spacing with multiples of 4px we start with 4px (or .125em) equally 50. This way we can easily expand the spacing tokens as needed. These changes: have already been made in components that made use of the original spacing design tokens so if you update your components to the latest version - you will get these updates &#x2018;for free&#x2019;. also effects the naming of the utility classes that some are using in their sites and products. You will need to update those CSS classes accordingly to benefit from these changes.

Type of component: We use a variation of the atomic design methodology, read about the differences here. We use: elements, blocks, and containers. an element would be a heading, or a button a block would be a teaser, or a search form a container would be a group of teasers Name of component: Go for something simple and obvious (todo: we need a guide/documentation on how we name things). Don&apos;t worry about namespacing and prefixing, the tooling will take care of this. NPM package: If you&apos;re making something interesting (probably not an &apos;element&apos;), then saying &apos;yes&apos; will allow the component to be shared as an optional part of the framework on NPM.

At the lower level there are components which are a type of ingredient used to assembl into the higher level patterns that are richer templates with usability guidance. Type 1: Components Components are intended for re-use and should be named for what they are; that is: vf-box (not vf-introduction ) vf-button (not vf-call-to-action ) vf-grid (not vf-wide-layout ) vf-header (not vf-big-headline ) vf-form Why?

Components have Lots of code Generally that CSS/Sass and some JS An HTML code template (Nunjucks) Documentation on how to use Type 2: Patterns If your pattern is primarily intended to be used for particular websites or a brand, give it a name that is attached to the role it performs; that is: vf-group-masthead vf-registration-form vf-start-page Why?

{"id":"145", "title": "Sass and CSS guidelines ", "text": "  Sass and CSS guidelines CSS Naming conventions Components in the Visual Framework follow the BEM naming convention. .component { } .component__item { } .component--alternative { } Namespacing We namespace all universal components with a prefix of vf-. This ensures that the component will not break an existing codebase. .vf-component { } This allows the Visual Framework to also include team specific components that are owned by those teams. .embl-grid { } Design Patterns and Components The Visual Framework makes use of Atomic Design-style concepts to define components. Instead of using Atoms, Molecules, Organisms the Visual Framework uses the terms Elements, Blocks, and Containers. In code we do not include further prefixes for the Visual Frameworks version of Atomic Design. Instead we rely on other components to help determine what is an Element, a Block, or a Container. Elements An Element: headings, lists, buttons, dividers, links, etc. are named after what they are semantically. .vf-text { } .vf-text-heading--3 { } Blocks A Block: headers, lists, etc. are a single purpose design component that is also named after what it does or where it would go as part of a document structure. It makes use of Elements in the HTML where needed. .vf-breadcrumbs { } .vf-page-header { } In the HTML the Visual Framework makes use of | to separate Element classes from Block classes &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-heading vf-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-heading vf-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; Mixes When creating components you may find that a block you are wanting to use needs specific styling within it&apos;s parent. To do this we make use of BEM&apos;s mixes. Where not only do you include the relevant classnames for the block but add an additional class that includes the parent classname. For example, the page header has two text nodes: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-text vf-text--heading-3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-text vf-text--heading-4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; The span needs to be a grey colour instead of the default black so we add a mix class to it. Instead of including the elements and relying on the parent class (.vf-page-header) to alter the styling, writing our HTML like this: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-text vf-text-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-text vf-text-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; We add component specific mix classes to the h1 and span to be able to style them: &lt;header vf-page-header &gt; &lt;h1 vf-page-header__heading | vf-text vf-text-heading--3 &gt;Communications&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;span vf-page-header__sub-heading | vf-text vf-text-heading--4 &gt;Blog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/header&gt; Notes It is good practice when creating a component to include a mix for any child element used. All mix classes should be written in the parents .scss file. So for the vf-page-header example we would write the required CSS in that component&apos;s .scss file rather than in the vf-text.scss file. Containers A Container is a horizontal slice of a page that contains Blocks and Elements. A Container is named after its purpose rather than an abstract concept. &lt;div vf-intro &gt; &lt;h1 vf-intro__heading &gt;Cancer&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p vf-lede &gt;Cancer is a generic term for lots of different diseases in which cells divide many more times than usual. This abnormal growth can affect many cell types in almost any part of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p vf-intro__text &gt;Cancer is a multi-stage process. Normal cells begin to divide abnormally, spreading beyond their normal boundaries, and abnormal tissue growth causes swellings called tumours to form. Tumours can be benign &#x2013; with no harmful effect on the body &#x2013; or malignant, invading healthy tissue and interfering with normal bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p vf-intro__text &gt;There are more than 100 types of cancer and symptoms vary depending on the type. &lt;a href= JavaScript:Void(0); &gt;Read more about Cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; How to write your Sass A core principle of the Visual Framework is simple integration into workflows. Accordingly, we use Sass in this project but keep it close to CSS structure so that it&apos;s easily understandable. Nesting Sass allows Nesting of CSS. This is a very nice feature but can be over used and abused. To stop this getting out of hand you should only nest media queries, pseudo classes and where referencing the parent makes sense (things like .vf-no-js and modernizr classes). For example, in Sass: a { text-decoration: none; &amp;:hover { text-decoration: underline; } @media (min-width: 800px) { font-weight: 700; } .vf-no-js &amp; { color: blue; } } And the compiled CSS: a { text-decoration: none; } a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } @media (min-width: 800px) { a { font-weight: 700; } } .vf-no-js a { color: blue; } Variables Variables in Sass allow you to reuse things like font stacks, colors and margins etc. Within the UI Pattern Library there is a file within the global folder called _variables.scss where these are defined. If you find yourself repeating a declaration in your CSS a few times it may be worth adding a new variable for this. Try to be as abstract as you can when naming it. For example rather than write $tab-navigation-padding: 10px; and $tab-card-padding: 10px; consider writing $tab-padding or $padding-small; so that it can be used elsewhere without confusion. Mixins By default there are only a limited amount of mixins in the UI Pattern Library. They are more to make writing code easier than doing anything fancy. If you take a look at the _mixin.scss file that&apos;s in the global folder in the scss folder there is a mixin that will make writing media queries, responsive typography and placeholders&apos;s easier when using a component. As this UI Pattern Library can make it&apos;s way into various aspects of the company mixins should be kept to a minimum so that it is easy to understand what they do. Working on a project When you&apos;re working on a project you may need to make notes for things to get back to, or things that are&apos;t done and could change. You should use Sass comments for this. If you have written some code that needs something fixed or added to then add a comment prefixed with @todo. Something l Rike this: // @todo fix height issue If you have written some code that may change as it maybe something that gets pushed back into the patter library or something that may change by design use @maychange. It would look something like this: // @maychange this shade of blue may change in next design overhaul Your code editor can help you find these when mopping up before a project goes live.

{"id":"146", "title": "Governance of the Visual Framework ", "text": "  Governance of the Visual Framework The Visual Framework 2.0 is an open source project meant for the wider life science community, so the maintainers aim to be transparent about what goes in vf-core, what doesn&apos;t and why decisions are made. The guiding spirit of the Visual Framework can be summed up as: Instead of a quick way to implement one look and feel, the Visual Framework is a way to quickly implement the look and feel needed for your content, data, users and organisation. More background here. What goes in Code committed to vf-core should meet these measures: Not lock you into a particular brand look and feel Be useful to many organisations Be mindful of constraints and use cases common for life science content and data Be compatible with a variety of frontend solutions Be modular and extensible Where ideas are proposed and discussed Ideas are typically discussed on chat and GitHub issues and decisions are documented there. What&apos;s in decision We aim to capture: What was agreed Why it was agreed Forever-hold-your-peace Who makes the decision In spirit, the community but in practice that falls to the maintainers and those asking for change. Who are the maintainers? Currently (as of April 2019) it&apos;s limited to EMBL and EMBL-EBI developers, but we aim to expand this into a consultative group after beta.1 in late spring/summer 2019.

{"id":"147", "title": "JavaScript guidelines ", "text": "  JavaScript guidelines Just enough JavaScript The Visual Framework isn&apos;t intended as a general-purpose JavaScript solution, however we know it is helpful that a minimal amount of basic functionality is supported. All components are provided as functional solutions, so where JavaScript is required (such as tabs) there is a fully functional set of JavaScript bundled and available in: vf-tabs.js and scripts.js An opt-in philosophy But we know many users would prefer to use their own JavaScript tooling for all -- or some -- components on a case-by-case basis. Why? As Adobe&apos;s Spectrum CSS puts it: We have found that JavaScript is where a framework or library quickly becomes opinionated and stops being easy to use with or across other frameworks. To avoid this problem, Spectrum CSS avoids implementation details that require JavaScript. Likewise we don&apos;t require the use of the Visual Framework JavaScript, instead the behviour can be optionally invoke per-component with JavaScript data selectors. So to activate the Visual Framework JavaScript for vf-tabs we add data-vf-js-tabs and data-vf-js-tabs-content, like so: &lt;div vf-tabs &gt; &lt;ul vf-tabs__list data-vf-js-tabs&gt; &lt;li vf-tabs__item &gt; &lt;a vf-tabs__link href= #vf-tabs__section--10 &gt;Second tab set&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li vf-tabs__item &gt; &lt;a vf-tabs__link href= #vf-tabs__section--11 &gt;Tab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div vf-tabs-content data-vf-js-tabs-content&gt; &lt;section vf-tabs__section id= vf-tabs__section--10 &gt; &lt;h2&gt;Section 10&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section vf-tabs__section id= vf-tabs__section--11 &gt; &lt;h2&gt;Section 11&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Leaving these data selectors off will cause vf-tabs.js to simply ignore the tabs. Naming The name of your selector should follow your component&apos;s name, plus an additional -js- prefix. So: vf-tabs = data-vf-js-tabs vf-messages = data-vf-js-messages mycompany-modal = data-mycompany-js-modal Last updated on 9 Apr 2019  A toolkit to quickly build better life science websites.

{"id":"149", "title": "Versioning ", "text": "  Versioning The Visual Framework vf-core and its components have self-contained versions. The Visual Framework uses semantic versioning across all projects and packages. Here are some highlights of what this means: All components are compatible with with vf-core, some components may require a minimum version of vf-core If vf-core has a breaking change it will be updated a full version (v2.0 &#x2192; v3.0), and compnaents may also need to be updated Yarn is used for package management Minimum versions of dependencies are specificed in project&apos;s package.json Component also use semantic versioning Related: Notes on component versioning Components may also require minimum versions of other components Confused? Think of it like your computer&apos;s operating system, just because you update Windows 10 doesn&apos;t always mean your Firefox version needs to change. Where to get the latest version Versions of vf-core and components are published to npm; see the Visual Framework building guide. Release notes Release notes are published to the GitHub releases tab. Where&apos;s version 1 of vf-core? Where&apos;s version 1.x, you ask? That&apos;s the EMBL-EBI specific Visual Framework from where this concept originated, and evolved.
