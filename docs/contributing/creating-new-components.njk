This codebase includes a folder and file creation tool. It allows you to quickly create all the required files to make a component. It gives you the option to create am element, block, or container.

1. Install Yeoman
   - If you've come this far and you don't have `yo`, you should be able to install it with `npm install -g yo@latest`
   - If you get stuck, [see the official install guide](http://yeoman.io/codelab/setup.html)
1. Create a new component
   - Run `gulp vf-component` and answer the questions when prompted.
       - **Type of component:** We use a variation of the atomic design methodology, [read about the differences here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms). We use: elements, blocks, and containers.
           - an element would be a heading, or a button
           - a block would be a teaser, or a search form
           - a container would be a group of teasers
       - **Name of component:** Go for something simple and obvious (todo: we need a guide/documentation on how we name things). Don't worry about namespacing and prefixing, the tooling will take care of this.
       - **NPM package:** If you're making something interesting (probably not an 'element'), then saying 'yes' will allow the component to be shared as an optional part of the framework on NPM.
    - Your customised template component will is in the `/components` directory.
1. Add the `@import 'vf-your-component.scss';` to `/assets/scss/styles.scss`.
1. Developing your component
   - Edit your template files in the `/components/your-component-name` folder
       - For further guidance on component configuration, [consult the comments in the component template files](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/tools/component-generator/templates).
   - Run `gulp vf-dev` to compile and preview the component
1. Sharing you component back
   - Publish it to npm; or
   - If you think your component is of use to the wider `vf-core` community, [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/pulls).

 Tip: also consult the [guidelines](guidelines) for the naming of things and coding standards.
