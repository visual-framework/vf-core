What to do and what not to do.

## Things we want to take another look at:

- CSS order: as we are using grid and flexbox for layout it feels like alphabetical is a little antiquated as we would are writing CSS for the component and the components children in the same ruleset.

- CSS custom properties: How do we include these, how do we make sure older browsers still get something.

- Browser support documentation: I guess we can borrow this from current VF?

- Universal Components: how we should be writing code for everyone, including screen readers. Where to add `aria` things etc.

- JavaScript: although the docs essentially say "don't use this" we need to work _how_ we are going to write JS for any component that needs it and how we should be writing that. We will need JS for outage notifications, global footers, GDPR...
