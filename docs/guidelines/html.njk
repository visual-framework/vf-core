## General Principles

1. All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.
1. Strictly enforce the agreed upon style.
1. If in doubt when deciding upon a style, use existing, common patterns.
1. Only one CSS selector should exist across the entire source of your code-base.

## Whitespace

1. Always be consistent in your use of whitespace.
1. Use whitespace to improve readability.
1. Never mix spaces and tabs for indentation.
1. Use only soft indents (spaces) not real tabs.
1. Only use 2 spaces per indentation level.

Tip: configure your editor to "show invisibles". This will allow you to eliminate end of line whitespace, eliminate unintended blank line whitespace, and avoid polluting commits.

## Format

1. Always use lowercase tag and attribute names.
1. Write one discrete element per line.
1. Use one additional level of indentation for each nested element.
1. Use valueless boolean attributes (e.g. checked rather than checked="checked").
1. Always use double quotes to quote attribute values.
1. Omit the type attributes from link stylesheet, style and script elements.
1. Always include closing tags.
1. Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements.
1. Keep line-length to a sensible maximum of 80 columns.

Example:
```HTML
<ul class="vf-breadcrumbs | vf-list vf-list--inline">
  <li class="vf-breadcrumbs__item">
    <a class="vf-breadcrumbs__link">Explore</a>
  </li>
  <li class="vf-breadcrumbs__item">
    <a class="vf-breadcrumbs__link">Topics</a>
  </li>
  <li class="vf-breadcrumbs__item">
    Center
  </li>
</ul>
```


## Exceptions and slight deviations

Elements with multiple attributes can have attributes arranged across multiple lines in an effort to improve readability and produce more useful diffs.

Example:
```HTML
<a class="[value]"
 data-action="[value]"
 data-id="[value]"
 href="[url]">
    <span>[text]</span>
</a>
```

## Attribute order

HTML attributes should be listed in an order that reflects the fact that class names are the primary interface through which CSS and JavaScript select elements.

1. class
2. id
3. data-*
4. Everything else

Example:
```HTML
<a class="[value]" id="[value]" data-name="[value]" href="[url]">[text]</a>
```
