## Release notes

You can [view all releases in the GitHub release log](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/releases).

## Release policy

Releases of vf-core are done monthly on the last Thursday in each month.

## Versioning

As not all users of the Visual Framework will be able to update to the very latest and we do not wish to hold others back, we are using a [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) style of releases.

| Major release | Minor release | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| (Branch)      | (Tag)         | |
| 2.0           | v2.0.0        | Initial release evolving from Compliance theme |
| "             | v2.0.1        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.2        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.3        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.1           | v2.1.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| "             | v2.1.1        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.2           | v2.2.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| 3.0           | v3.0.0        | Major release with many breaking changes|

We support the last two minor releases with bug fixes and branding. New features will only be added to the current and development versions.

Where's version 1.x, you ask? That's the [EMBL-EBI specific Visual Framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework) from where this concept [originated, and evolved](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2018/09/12/faster-scientific-websites-through-reusability/).

### Test releases

Testing releases will be identified in their tag, a la: `v2.0-alpha.1`, where `-alpha.1` is the tag. `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc` are tag suffixes.
