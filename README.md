# The Visual Framework Core (`vf-core`)

## Where's `master`?

This project does not use a `master` branch; why? 

- To use `vf-core` or its components in production do not clone the git repo
- Stable "truth" is at on npm; [here's a usage guide](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-welcome/building)
- Latest development is on the `develop` branch

n.b. 
- Stable code is also available in [tagged releases](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/releases) but we _do not_ recommend using those in production
- For more background on why we don't use `master`, [see this issue](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/698)
