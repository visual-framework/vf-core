{{ milestone('Tables tooling and best practice','26') }}

Tables are broadly used across scientific content and applications. What does a good one look like, and how does it behave? Tooling and foundational guidance.

{{ milestone('Foundational responsive design tooling and best practice','27') }}

We have quite a few rough edges on mobile, it’s time to sort them. These go beyond simple “collapse on mobile” and involve more complex questions like “how do filter facets behave?”

{{ milestone('Design documentation, alignment: Usage of icons, illustrations','28') }}

What is the distinction? Can we document when each should be used? We need technical tooling.

{{ milestone('A selection of example pages and boilerplates','17') }}

There are many ways to implement a "search" page and section. What is the most common and standardizable? What about for a research group? A user's profile page?

## By end of October 2021

{{ milestone('Create a training programme for developers','21') }}

How to get started with the VF common scenarios specific use cases.

{{ milestone('Component long tail','19') }}

There are several low-priority components that still need to be implemented, such as:  data tables, definition lists, table of contents.

{{ milestone('Forms on mobile','18') }}

Establish and implement how to best handle long section of form options on mobile.

{{ milestone('Explore internal and functional components and patterns','23') }}

Most of the components and patterns in the VF 2.0 have been designed with the corporate EMBL websites in mind. Among the founding ideas was to have variants based on a two-dimensional axis (internal vs external, and functional vs inspirational). How would we deliver and document these? Is it the correct idea?

{{ milestone('Optimising the component library build efficiency','22') }}

Currently, the component library relies on Fractal, this is helpful in many ways but also limits some options. In principle, we could solely rely on 11ty for our component library but there are performance questions.

- part of the reason 11ty is so slow is because of how it relates to fractal
- it could be possible to optimise the order in which fractal builds new page, so even if 11ty has to build all the pages, it could at least build the page you need first
- to not to rebuild for CSS changes

{{ milestone('contentHub metrics and editing','24') }}

The contentHub allows us to pull content into any VF-powered page, however we can do more here: how to track where content is used? how to better support editing?

### React and Angular components

While the Visual Framework does not require specific tooling, we know two of the places the VF will be used are in React and Angular. We could provide native templates as part of the individual components.

    {{ milestone('Create a desktop component library','20') }}

    That is: port the Sketch component library to Figma and update it to match changes.

    {{ milestone('Legacy browser support','16') }}

    Supporting older browsers (those without CSS grid and custom properties/variables) is a non-trivial task that needs constant monitoring and support.

    {{ milestone('Introduce a type scale','25') }}

    The VF typography and spacing continues to be refined, however we're still lacking an explicit type scale.
