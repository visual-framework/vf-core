The Design Tokens used within `vf-core` are generated from several `.yml` files. These are then compiled into various Sass files as needed.

In the future we hope to offer Sketch and Photoshop colour palettes.

If you required a different format (LESS, iOS, Android). Please get in touch.

## What are Design Tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## How EMBL uses Design Tokens

### Base Design Tokens

These are the generic values for things

### Design Decision Design Tokens

Where we have decided where to use what token and what purpose.

### Component Design Tokens

Where the design decisions have filtered into specific component decisions.

These are exported into the components folder and are suffixed - `.tokens.scss`.

These can be both Sass variables and CSS Custom Properties.

## Naming Design Tokens

We use a BEM style syntax when composing Design Tokens where we use our Design System prefix of `vf-` followed by:

1. Component
<small>eg: button, card, hero, list</small>

2. Category
<small>eg: backgroudn, shadow, border</small>

4. Variant
<small>eg: primary, secondary, interactive</small>

4. State
<small>eg: hover, visited, focus</small>


## Building

To update these run `gulp vf-tokens` from `./components/vf-design-tokens`.
