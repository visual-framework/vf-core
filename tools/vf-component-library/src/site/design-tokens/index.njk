The Design Tokens used within `vf-core` are generated from several `.yml` files. These are then compiled into various Sass files as needed.

In the future we hope to offer Sketch and Photoshop colour palettes.

If you required a different format (LESS, iOS, Android). Please get in touch.

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## Building

To update these run `gulp vf-tokens` from `./components/vf-design-tokens`.
