The Visual Framework uses [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) across all projects and packages. Here are some highlights of what this means:

- All components are compatible with with `vf-core`, some components may require a minimum version of `vf-core`
- If `vf-core` has a breaking change it will be updated a full version (`v2.0` â†’ `v3.0`), and compnaents may also need to be updated
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is used for package management
- Minimum versions of dependencies are specificed in project's `package.json`
- Component also use semantic versioning

- Components may also require minimum versions of other components

Confused? Think of it like your computer's operating system, just because you update Windows 10 doesn't always mean your Firefox version needs to change.

## Where to get the latest version

Versions of `vf-core` and components are published to npm; [see the Visual Framework building guide]({{ '/building/' | url }}).

## Release notes

Release notes are published to [the GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/releases).

## Where's version 1 of `vf-core`?

Where's version 1.x, you ask? That's the [EMBL-EBI specific Visual Framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework) from where this concept [originated, and evolved](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2018/09/12/faster-scientific-websites-through-reusability/).

## Test releases

Testing releases will be identified in their tag, a la: `v2.0-alpha.1`, where `-alpha.1` is the tag. `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc` are tag suffixes.
