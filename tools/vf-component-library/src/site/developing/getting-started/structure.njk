## Design decisions and tokens

The Visual Framework uses the [Design Token concept](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/tokens-in-design-systems-25dd82d58421) to specify design (colour, spacing, type) as reusable JSON or YAML that are translated from `.yml` data into `.scss` using [Theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo#-theo).

This Design Token abstraction [helps portability and integration](https://uxdesign.cc/design-tokens-for-dummies-8acebf010d71) with other technical systems.

You can find the Design Tokens in `vf-core/components/vf-design-tokens`.

## File structure

{# Tree map generated with
   tree -L 2 . -I 'node_modules|cache|test_*|.git|.github|bin' -a
#}

The `vf-core` repo contains three types of files:

1. Components that are located in `./components`
2. Build scripts located in the `.tools/` of the project (mainly)
3. The public web interface `./tools/vf-component-library`
