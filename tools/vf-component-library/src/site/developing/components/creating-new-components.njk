1. [Install the `vf-component-generator` package](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/tools/vf-component-generator)
   - `yarn add @visual-framework/vf-component-generator --dev`
1. Install Yeoman
   - If you've come this far and you don't have `yo`, you should be able to install it with `yarn global add yo@latest`
   - If you get stuck, [see the official install guide](http://yeoman.io/codelab/setup.html)
1. Create a new component
   - Run [`vf-component-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visual-framework/vf-component-generator) and answer the questions when prompted.
       - **Type of component:** [See component guidance]({{ '/guidance/components-and-patterns' | url }})
       - **Name of component:** [See component naming guidance]({{ '/guidance/components-and-patterns' | url }})
       - **NPM package:** If you're making something interesting (probably not an 'element'), then saying 'yes' will allow the component to be shared as an optional part of the framework on NPM.
    - Your customised template component will be in the `/components` directory.
1. Add the `@import 'vf-your-component.scss';` to `/assets/scss/styles.scss`.
1. Developing your component
   - Edit your template files in the `/components/your-component-name` folder
       - For further guidance on component configuration, [consult the comments in the component template files](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/tools/component-generator/templates).
   - Run `gulp vf-dev` to compile and preview the component
1. Sharing you component back
   - Publish it to npm; and/or
   - If you think your component is useful to the global `vf-core` community, [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/pulls) or [open an issue](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/new/choose) to discuss.

 Tip: also consult the [guidelines]({{ '/guidance/components-and-patterns' | url }}) for the naming of things and coding standards.
