## What's in a component?

A component is made up of these files:

- CHANGELOG.md
  - Notable changes
- index.scss
  - Used to generate a standalone version of the component's CSS
- package.json
  - Version information and any npm required dependencies; you should avoid npm-requiring other VF components
- README.md
  - Information on the role and how to use a component
- vf-sample.config.yml
  - Configuration information about the compony, release status, type of component, variants
- vf-sample.njk
  - A Nunjuck-based template
- vf-sample.scss
  - Styling
- vf-sample.js
  - JavaScript
- vf-sample.react.js
  - [React wrapper](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/tools/vf-extensions-react#box-component)


## Some files will also be dynamically made at build time

- _package.variables.scss_
  - Variables extracted from package.json that can be used in the Sass, such as a version number
- _vf-sample.precompiled.js_
  - A compiled version of the Nunjucks template
- _vf-sample.css_
  - Standalone CSS made from the index.scss
