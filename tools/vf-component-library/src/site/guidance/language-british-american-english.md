The `vf-core` project is being led by [EMBL](//www.embl.org) where British English is used, we're also aware that most code is American English (`colour` vs `color`); so:

 - 📚🇬🇧 Documentation is written in British English 💂‍ `Rarely use centred text, always use colours`
 - ⌨️🇺🇸 Code is written in American english 🧢 `$vf-main-color: green;`
