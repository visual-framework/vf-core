Resize your images manually, or have your CMS or image proxy do the cropping.

- The Visual Framework CSS will try to handle incorrectly sized or wrong aspect ratio image as a 'fallback'.
- Consider adding width and height to [help the layout engine in browsers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/setting-height-width-images-important-again/).

This is a work in progress, see [#1230](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/1230)
