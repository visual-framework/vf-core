title: Components are part of patterns
subtitle: Think of components as lego blocks you can use to build the look and content of your sites. Think of patterns as assembled packages of behaviour.
intro: At the lower level there are components which are a type of "ingredient" used to assemble into the higher level patterns with richer templates with usability guidance.

  Components are intended for re-use and should be named for what they are; that is:

  - vf-box (not "vf-introduction")
  - vf-button (not "vf-call-to-action")
  - vf-grid (not "vf-wide-layout")
  - vf-header (not "vf-big-headline")
  - vf-form

  This ensures that that a box will always be rectangular-ish pattern on pages,
  whereas an "introduction" may be a box today, but become simply large text after a redesign.

  When naming components, use something simple and obvious.

  ### Component types

  We use a variation of the atomic design methodology. We use: elements, blocks, and containers.

  - `element`: a heading or button
  - `block`: a teaser, summary or search form
  - `container`: would be a group of summaries

  [More about VF component types](/guidance/components-and-patterns/)

  ### Components have

  - Lots of code
    - `CHANGELOG.md`: Notable changes
    - `index.scss`: Used to generate a standalone version of the component's CSS
    - `package.json`: Version information and any required npm dependencies
      - you should avoid npm-requiring other VF components
    - `README.md`: Information on the role and how to use a component
    - `vf-sample.config.yml`: Configuration information about the compony, release status, type of component, variants
    - `vf-sample.njk`: A Nunjuck-based template
    - `vf-sample.scss`: Styling
    - `vf-sample.js`: JavaScript
    - `vf-sample.react.js`: [React wrapper](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/tools/vf-extensions-react#box-component)
    - `Dynamic files made at build time`
      - `_package.variables.scss_`: Variables extracted from package.json that can be used in the Sass, such as a version number
      - `_vf-sample.precompiled.js_`: A compiled version of the Nunjucks template
      - `_vf-sample.css_`: Standalone CSS made from the index.scss
  - An HTML code template (Nunjucks)
  - Documentation on how to use

  <article class="vf-content">

If your pattern is primarily intended to be used for particular websites or a brand,
give it a name that is attached to the role it performs; that is:

- vf-group-masthead
- vf-registration-form
- vf-start-page

Naming for the role the pattern does allows us to change the future visual structure,
so a "display headline" today may have a black background, but tomorrow might have no background
and be large and italic text.

### Patterns have

- An HTML code template (Nunjucks)
- Documentation on how to use
