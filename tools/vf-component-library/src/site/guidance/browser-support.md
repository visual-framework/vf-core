<br/>

For browser support, aim for content and functionality to be unobstructed on browsers released within the last five years and have JavaScript enabled; this is represents virtually all users of the EMBL sites (in excess of 99.9%).

As a guiding rule, test for compatibility on any browser or device that represents more than 2% of the usage of www.embl.org.

As intended by the CSS specification, not all browsers, devices, or users render content to look exactly the same. Our aim is to create an accessible and visually consistent design across a broad range of clients, not pixel-perfect designs. Further, we build atop the basic functionality, adding progressive-enhancement features to newer classes of browsers and devices.

This is a work in progress, see [#1202](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/1202)
