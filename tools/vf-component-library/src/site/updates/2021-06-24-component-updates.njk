The presentation of [design token information](/design-tokens) has been improved, grouping the range of tokens into sizing, typography and thematic colours. You'll be able to more easily access the values and Sass maps.

You'll also find improvements to `vf-breadcrumbs` and more flexibility with `vf-search-client-side`.

For our next beta, we aim to [improve the colour of typography](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/1587) by moving to an off-black. We'll also begin to focus on [improving navigation patterns](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/discussions/1560), including [the footer](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/discussions/1529). With those done we hope to release rollup 2.5.0 in July.

Read on for more.

As a reminder, the rollup CSS and JS are compilations of many independently versioned components and is likely to contain changes that may disrupt the look of your site. We advise testing. Even better is to build your own CSS rollup from the npm sources, [you can find a guide here]({{ '/building' | url }}).

{#- don't forget to add the latest version to /tools/vf-component-library/src/site/_data/siteConfig.js -#}
