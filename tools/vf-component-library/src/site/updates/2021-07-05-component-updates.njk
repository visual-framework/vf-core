The usage of [design token information](/design-tokens) has been improved with many components now fully using the token for typography colours. Additionally, we have improved the accessibility of the main text colour to be an off-black. Previously it was an [over-contrasted solid `#000` black](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/1587#issuecomment-866668118).

We've also made small fixes and documentation improvements to `vf-hero`, the ELIXIR banner and the `vf-profile`.

For our next beta we aim to continue documentation polish and some [foundational work on navigation patterns](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/discussions/1299) during a sprint the week of 19 July. With those done we hope to release rollup 2.5.0 by mid-August.

Read on for more.

As a reminder, the rollup CSS and JS are compilations of many independently versioned components and is likely to contain changes that may disrupt the look of your site. We advise testing. Even better is to build your own CSS rollup from the npm sources, [you can find a guide here]({{ '/building' | url }}).
