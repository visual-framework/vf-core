## About

**This is an early alpha and subject to radical change or removal.**

This project supports React sites using Visual Framework components, like [vf-react](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-react). It has reusable componentised code and config.

Note: most VF Nunjucks extensions are supported in principle, but we're still exploring

2. Install and import your desired component:
    - `import { VfCard } from "@visual-framework/vf-card/vf-card.react.js";`
3. Use your desired component
    - `<VfCard card_title="test" variant="striped" newTheme="primary" card_image="https://acxngcvroo.cloudimg.io/v7/https://www.embl.org/files/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SCHOOLS_1011_ells-learninglab_hd_01_Cool_500px.jpg" card_text="im some text" card_image__alt="people"></VfCard>`
