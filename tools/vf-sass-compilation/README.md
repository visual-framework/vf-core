# vf-sass-compilation

Build the Sass for Visual Framework projects

## To do

This component is in early development and will be used to break apart the previously
monolithic functionality of vf-core.

- Break this component into build process for JS and Nunjucks templates (and perhaps more)
- Move the relevant Gulp scripts to this component
- Documentation on how to use without installing vf-core
